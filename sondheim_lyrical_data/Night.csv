A Little Night Music,Now,"Now, as the sweet imbecilities"
A Little Night Music,Now,Tumble so lavishly
A Little Night Music,Now,"Onto her lap,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"Now, there are two possibilities:"
A Little Night Music,Now,"A, I could ravish her,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"B, I could nap."
A Little Night Music,Now,Say
A Little Night Music,Now,"It's the ravishment, then we see"
A Little Night Music,Now,The option
A Little Night Music,Now,"That follows, of course:"
A Little Night Music,Now,"A,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"The deployment of charm, or B,"
A Little Night Music,Now,The adoption
A Little Night Music,Now,Of physical force.
A Little Night Music,Now,"Now, B might arouse her,"
A Little Night Music,Now,But if I assume
A Little Night Music,Now,I trip on my trouser
A Little Night Music,Now,Leg crossing the room...
A Little Night Music,Now,"Her hair getting tangled,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"Her stays getting snapped,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"My nerves would be jangled,"
A Little Night Music,Now,My energy sapped...
A Little Night Music,Now,Removing her clothing
A Little Night Music,Now,"Would take me all day,"
A Little Night Music,Now,And her subsequent loathing
A Little Night Music,Now,"Would turn me away,"
A Little Night Music,Now,Which eliminates B
A Little Night Music,Now,And which leaves us with A.
A Little Night Music,Now,"Now, insofar as approaching it,"
A Little Night Music,Now,What would be festive
A Little Night Music,Now,But have its effect?
A Little Night Music,Now,"Now, there are two ways of broaching it:"
A Little Night Music,Now,"A, the suggestive,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"And B, the direct."
A Little Night Music,Now,Say
A Little Night Music,Now,"That I settle on B, to wit,"
A Little Night Music,Now,A charmingly
A Little Night Music,Now,"Lecherous mood,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"A,"
A Little Night Music,Now,I could put on my nightshirt or sit
A Little Night Music,Now,"Disarmingly,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"B, in the nude."
A Little Night Music,Now,That might be effective;
A Little Night Music,Now,My body's all right--
A Little Night Music,Now,But not in perspective
A Little Night Music,Now,And not in the light.
A Little Night Music,Now,I'm bound to be chilly
A Little Night Music,Now,"And feel a buffoon,"
A Little Night Music,Now,But nightshirts are silly
A Little Night Music,Now,In mid-afternoon.
A Little Night Music,Now,"Which leaves the suggestive,"
A Little Night Music,Now,But how to proceed?
A Little Night Music,Now,"Although she gets restive,"
A Little Night Music,Now,Perhaps I could read.
A Little Night Music,Now,In view of her penchant
A Little Night Music,Now,"For something romantic,"
A Little Night Music,Now,De Sade is to trenchant
A Little Night Music,Now,"And Dickens too frantic,"
A Little Night Music,Now,And Stendhal would ruin
A Little Night Music,Now,"The plan of attack,"
A Little Night Music,Now,As there isn't much blue in
A Little Night Music,Now,"""The Red and the Black."""
A Little Night Music,Now,De Maupassant's candour
A Little Night Music,Now,"Would cause her dismay,"
A Little Night Music,Now,The Brontes are grander
A Little Night Music,Now,"But not very gay,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"Her taste is much blander,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"I'm sorry to say,"
A Little Night Music,Now,But is Hans Christian Ander-
A Little Night Music,Now,Sen ever risque?
A Little Night Music,Now,Which eliminates A...
A Little Night Music,Now,"Now, with my mental facilities"
A Little Night Music,Now,Partially muddied
A Little Night Music,Now,"And ready to snap,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"Now, though there are possibilities"
A Little Night Music,Now,"Still to be studied,"
A Little Night Music,Now,I might as well nap.
A Little Night Music,Now,Bow
A Little Night Music,Now,Though I must
A Little Night Music,Now,To adjust
A Little Night Music,Now,"My original plan,"
A Little Night Music,Now,How
A Little Night Music,Now,Shall I sleep
A Little Night Music,Now,Half as deep
A Little Night Music,Now,"As I usually can,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"When now I still want and/or love you,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"Now as always,"
A Little Night Music,Now,"Now, Anne?"
A Little Night Music,Later,Later...
A Little Night Music,Later,When is later?
A Little Night Music,Later,"All you ever hear is ""Later, Henrik, Henrik, later."""
A Little Night Music,Later,"""Yes, we know, Henrik,"
A Little Night Music,Later,"Oh, Henrik,"
A Little Night Music,Later,"Everyone agrees, Henrik,"
A Little Night Music,Later,"Please, Henrik!"""
A Little Night Music,Later,"You have a thought you're fairly bursting with,"
A Little Night Music,Later,"A personal discovery or problem, and it's:"
A Little Night Music,Later,"""What's your rush, Henrik?"
A Little Night Music,Later,"Shush, Henrik!"
A Little Night Music,Later,"Goodness, how you gush, Henrik!"
A Little Night Music,Later,"Hush, Henrik!"""
A Little Night Music,Later,You murmur:
A Little Night Music,Later,"""I only--"
A Little Night Music,Later,"It's just that--"""
A Little Night Music,Later,"""For God's sake, later, Henrik!"""
A Little Night Music,Later,"""Henrik..."
A Little Night Music,Later,Who is Henrik?
A Little Night Music,Later,"Oh, that lawyer's son, the one who mumbles."
A Little Night Music,Later,"Short and boring,"
A Little Night Music,Later,"Yes, he's hardly worth ignoring,"
A Little Night Music,Later,"And who cares if he's all dammed--"""
A Little Night Music,Later,I beg your pardon--
A Little Night Music,Later,"""Up inside?"""
A Little Night Music,Later,"As I've often stated,"
A Little Night Music,Later,It's intolerable being tolerated.
A Little Night Music,Later,"""Reassure Henrik,"
A Little Night Music,Later,Poor Henrik.
A Little Night Music,Later,"Henrik, you'll endure"
A Little Night Music,Later,"Being pure, Henrik."""
A Little Night Music,Later,"Though I've been born, I've never been!"
A Little Night Music,Later,How can I wait around for later?
A Little Night Music,Later,I'll be ninety on my deathbead
A Little Night Music,Later,"And the late, or, rather, later, Henrik Egerman."
A Little Night Music,Later,Doesn't anything begin?
A Little Night Music,Soon,"Soon, I promise,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,"Soon, I won't shy away,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,Dear old--
A Little Night Music,Soon,"Soon, I want to."
A Little Night Music,Soon,"Soon, whatever you say."
A Little Night Music,Soon,"Even now,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,"When you're close and we touch,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,"And you're kissing my brow,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,I don't mind it too much.
A Little Night Music,Soon,"And you'll have to admit I'm endearing,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,"I help keep things humming,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,I'm not domineering--
A Little Night Music,Soon,What's one small shortcoming?
A Little Night Music,Soon,"And think of how I adore you,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,Think of how much you love me.
A Little Night Music,Soon,"If I were perfect for you,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,Wouldn't you tire of me
A Little Night Music,Soon,"Soon,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,"All too soon,"
A Little Night Music,Soon,Dear old
A Little Night Music,Soon,Soon
A Little Night Music,Soon,"""Later""..."
A Little Night Music,Soon,I promise
A Little Night Music,Soon,"When is ""Later""?"
A Little Night Music,Soon,Soon

A Little Night Music,Soon,"Everyone agrees, Henrik"""
A Little Night Music,Soon,Dear old—

A Little Night Music,Soon,Stendhal
A Little Night Music,Soon,"""Later, Henrik, later"""
A Little Night Music,Soon,Whatever you
A Little Night Music,Soon,As I've often stated:
A Little Night Music,Soon,"Eliminates A, but when?"
A Little Night Music,Soon,Say
A Little Night Music,Soon,When?
A Little Night Music,Soon,Even
A Little Night Music,Soon,Maybe
A Little Night Music,Soon,Now
A Little Night Music,Soon,Soon
A Little Night Music,Soon,Later
A Little Night Music,Soon,When you're close and we touch
A Little Night Music,Soon,Soon
A Little Night Music,Soon,I'll be ninety and dead
A Little Night Music,Soon,And you're kissing my brow
A Little Night Music,Soon,When I'm kissing your brow
A Little Night Music,Soon,And I'm stroking your head
A Little Night Music,Soon,I don't mind it too much
A Little Night Music,Soon,You'll come into my bed
A Little Night Music,Soon,And you'll have to admit
A Little Night Music,Soon,Since I have to admit
A Little Night Music,Soon,I'm endearing
A Little Night Music,Soon,I've been hearing
A Little Night Music,Soon,I find peering
A Little Night Music,Soon,I help keep things humming
A Little Night Music,Soon,All those tremulous cries
A Little Night Music,Soon,Through life's gray windows impatiently
A Little Night Music,Soon,I'm not domineering
A Little Night Music,Soon,"Patiently, not"
A Little Night Music,Soon,Not very cheering
A Little Night Music,Soon,What's one small shortcoming?
A Little Night Music,Soon,Interfering with those tremulous thighs
A Little Night Music,Soon,Do I fear death? Let it
A Little Night Music,Soon,And
A Little Night Music,Soon,Come to me
A Little Night Music,Soon,Think of how I adore you
A Little Night Music,Soon,Soon
A Little Night Music,Soon,Now
A Little Night Music,Soon,Think of how much you love me

A Little Night Music,Soon,Now
A Little Night Music,Soon,If I were perfect for you

A Little Night Music,Soon,Now
A Little Night Music,Soon,Wouldn't you tire of me
A Little Night Music,Soon,Soon
A Little Night Music,Soon,Now
A Little Night Music,Soon,Later?
A Little Night Music,Soon,Come to me soon
A Little Night Music,Soon,"If I'm dead, I can wait"
A Little Night Music,Soon,"We will, later"
A Little Night Music,Soon,Straight to me
A Little Night Music,Soon,Never mind how
A Little Night Music,Soon,How can I
A Little Night Music,Soon,We will...

A Little Night Music,Remember?,The cafe in the park where we talked--
A Little Night Music,Remember?,Remember?
A Little Night Music,Remember?,Remember?
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"The tenor on the boat that we chartered,"
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"Belching ""The Bartered Bride""--"
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"Ah, how we laughed! Ah, how we cried!"
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"Ah, how you promised, and ah, how I lied."
A Little Night Music,Remember?,That dilapidated in--
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"Remember, darling?"
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"The proprietess's grin,"
A Little Night Music,Remember?,Also her glare.
A Little Night Music,Remember?,Yellow gingham on the bed--
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"Remember, darling?"
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"And the canopy in red,"
A Little Night Music,Remember?,Needing repair.
A Little Night Music,Remember?,I think you were there.
A Little Night Music,Remember?,The local village dance on the green--
A Little Night Music,Remember?,Remember?
A Little Night Music,Remember?,Remember?
A Little Night Music,Remember?,The lady with the large tambourine--
A Little Night Music,Remember?,Remember?
A Little Night Music,Remember?,The one who played the harp in her boa
A Little Night Music,Remember?,Thought she was so adept.
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"Ah, how we laughed! Ah, how we wept!"
A Little Night Music,Remember?,"Ah, how we polka'd--"

A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,I'm sure it was...you.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"She lightens my sadness,"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"She livens my days,"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She bursts with a kind of madness

A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"One thousand whims to which I give in,"

A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"So completely demented, contented a fashion."
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"So sunlike, so winning,"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,So unlike a wife.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,I do think that I'm beginning
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,To show signs of life.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Don't ask me how at my age one still can grow--
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"If you met my wife, you'd know."
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"Dear Fredrik,"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,I'm just longing to meet her. Sometime.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She sparkles...
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,How pleasant.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She twinkles...
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,How nice.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Her youth is a sort of present--
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Whatever the price.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,The incandescent--what?--the--
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Light?
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,--of my life.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,You must meet my wife.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"Yes, I must. I really must. Now--"

A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,How charming.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She twitters.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,My word!
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She floats.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Isn't that alarming?
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"What is she, a bird?"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She makes me feel I'm--what?--
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,A very old man.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Yes--no!
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,No?
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,But--
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,I must meet your Gertrude.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,My Anne.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Sorry--Anne.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"She loves my voice, my walk, my mustache,"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"The cigar, in fact, that I'm smoking."
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"She'll watch me puff until it's just ash,"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Then she'll save the cigar butt.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"Bizarre, but"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,You're joking.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She dotes on--
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Your dimple.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,My snoring.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,How dear.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"The point is, she's really simple."
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"Yes, that much seems clear."
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She gives me funny names--
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Like?
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"""Old Dry-as-Dust."""
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Wouldn't she just?
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,You must meet my wife.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"Yes, I must, yes, I must."
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"A sea of whims that I submerge in,"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Yet so loveable in repentance.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"Unfortunately still a virgin,"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,But you can't force a flower--
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Don't finish that sentence!
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She's monstrous!
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She's frightened.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Unfeeling!
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Unversed.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,She'd strike you as unenlightened--
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"No, I'd strike her first."
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,"Her reticence, her apprehension--"
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Her crust!
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,No!
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Yes!

A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Fredrik!
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,You must meet my wife.
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,Let me get my hat and my knife!
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,What was that?
A Little Night Music,You Must Meet My Wife,I must meet your wife.

A Little Night Music,Liasons,To see them--indiscriminate
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"Women, it"

A Little Night Music,Liasons,Where is skill?
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Where is forethought?
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Where's discretion of the heart?
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Where's passion in the art?
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Where's craft?
A Little Night Music,Liasons,With a smile
A Little Night Music,Liasons,And a will
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"But with more thought,"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,I acquired a chateau
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Extravagantly o-
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Verstaffed.
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Too many people muddle sex
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"With mere desire,"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,And when emotion intervenes
A Little Night Music,Liasons,The nets descend.
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"It should on no account perplex,"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"Or worse, inspire;"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,It's but a pleasurable means
A Little Night Music,Liasons,To a measurable end.
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Why does no one comprehend?
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Let us hope this lunacy's just a trend.
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"Now where was I? Where was I? Oh, yes..."
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"In the castle of the King of the Belgians,"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,(We would visit through a false chiffonier)
A Little Night Music,Liasons,In the castle of the King of the Belgians
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"Who, when things got rather touchy,"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Deeded me a duchy...
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Liaisons! What's happened to them?
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Liaisons today.
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"Untidy! Take my daughter, I"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"Taught her, I"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Tried my best to point the way.
A Little Night Music,Liasons,I even named her Desiree.
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"In a world where the kings are employers,"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Where the amateur prevails
A Little Night Music,Liasons,And delicacy fails
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"To pay,"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,"In a world where the princes are lawyers,"
A Little Night Music,Liasons,What can anyone expect
A Little Night Music,Liasons,Except to recollect
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Lia....
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,She wouldn't...therefore they didn't...
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,So then it wasn't...not unless it...would she?
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,She doesn't...God knows she needn't...therefore it's not.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,He'd never...therefore they haven't...
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Which makes the question absolutely...could she?
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,She daren't...therefore I mustn't...what utter rot!
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Fidelity is more than mere display;
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,It's what a man expects from life.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Fidelity like mine to Desiree
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"And Charlotte, my devoted wife."
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"The papers...he mentioned papers,"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Some legal papers which I didn't see there.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"Where were they, the goddamn papers she had to sign?"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"What nonsense! He brought her papers,"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"They were important, so he had to be there."
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,I'll kill him!...Why should I bother? The woman's mine!
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"Besides, no matter what one might infer,"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,One must have faith to some degree.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,The least that I can do is trust in her
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,The way that Charlotte trusts in me.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"Capable, pliable"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"Women, women..."
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"Understanding and reliable,"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Knowing their place.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"Insufferable, yes, but gentle,"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Their weaknesses are incidental.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,A functional but ornamental
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Race.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"Durable, sensible"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"Women, women..."
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Very nearly indispensable
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Creatures of grace.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"God knows the foolishness about them,"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"But if one had to live without them,"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"The world would surely be a poorer,"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"If purer,"
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,Place.
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,The hip-bath...about that hip-bath...
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,How can you slip and trip into a hip-bath?
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,The papers...where were the papers?
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,"Of course, he might have taken back the papers."
A Little Night Music,In Praise of Women,She wouldn't...therefore they didn't...
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,The woman's mine!
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,Every day a little death
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"In the parlor, in the bed,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"In the curtains, in the silver,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"In the buttons, in the bread."
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,Every day a little sting
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"In the heart and in the head,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,Every move and every breath
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,(And you hardly feel a thing)
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,Brings a perfect little death.
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"He smiles sweetly, strokes my hair,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,Says he misses me.
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"I would murder him right there,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,But first I die.
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"He talks softly of his wars,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"And his horses, and his whores."
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,I think love's a dirty business.
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,So do I!
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,I'm before him on my knees So do I...
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,And he kisses me.
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"He assumes I lose my reason,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,And I do.
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"Men are stupid, men are vain,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"Love's disgusting, love's insane,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,A humiliating business.
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"Oh, how true!"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"Ah, well..."
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,Every day a little death
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,Every day a little death
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"In the parlor, in the bed,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"On the lips and in the eyes,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"In the curtains, in the silver, In the murmurs, in the pauses,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"In the buttons, in the bread. In the gestures, in the sighs."
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,Every day a little sting
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,Every day a little dies
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,In the heart and in the head. In the looks and in the lies.
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,"Every move and every breath,"
A Little Night Music,Every Day a Little Death,(And you hardly feel a thing)
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Brings a perfect little death.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Look, ma'am, an invitation,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Here, ma'am, delivered by hand."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"And, ma'am, I notice the station-"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Ary's engraved and very grand.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Petra, how too exciting!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Just when I need it!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Petra, such elegant writing,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,So chic you hardly can read it!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,What do you think?
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Who can it be?
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Even the ink--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"No, here, let me..."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"""Your presence""--just think of it, Petra!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"""Is kindly""--it's at a chateau!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"""Requested""--etcet'ra, etcet'ra,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"""Madame Leonora Armf--"" Oh, no!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,We're invited?
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,What a horrible plot!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,I'm excited!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"No, you're not."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"A weekend in the country, just imagine--"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,It's completely depraved.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,It's insulting.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,It's engraved.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"It's that woman, it's that Armfeldt!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Oh, the actress?"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"No, the ghoul!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"She may hope to make her charm felt,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,But she's mad if she thinks I would be such a fool
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,As to weekend in the country.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,How insulting!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,And I've nothing to wear.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Here! The last place I'm going is there.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Guess what? An invitation!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Guess who? Begins with an ""A."""
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"""Armfeldt""--is that a relation"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,To the decrepit Desiree?
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Guess when we're asked to go, sir?"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"See, sir, the date there."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Guess where? A fancy chateau, sir!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Guess, too, who's lying in wait there,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Setting her traps,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Fixing her face--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Darling, perhaps"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A change of pace--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Oh, no!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Would be charming,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,And the air would be fresh.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend with that woman?
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,In the country--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,In the flesh.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,I've some business with her mother.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"See, it's business."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Oh, no doubt!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,But the business with her mother
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Would be hardly the business I'd worry about.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Just a weekend in the country--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Smelling jasmine--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Watching little things grow.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Go!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"My darling, we'll simply say no."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Oh.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,How very amusing.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,But also inept.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend; of course we're refusing.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Au contraire! You must accept!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Oh, no!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,But it's frightful!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"No, you don't understand."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Is delightful
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,If it's planned.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Wear your hair down, and a flower,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Don't use makeup, dress in white."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,She'll grow older by the hour
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,And be hopelessly shattered by Saturday night.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Spend a weekend in the country.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,We'll accept it!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,I'd a feeling you would.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Yes, it's only polite that we should."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Good.

A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Well, what?"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Merely a weekend, still, I thought it might am-"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Use you to know
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Who's invited to go,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,This time with his pants.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,You don't mean...
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,I'll give you three guesses.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,She wouldn't...
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Reduce it to two.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,It can't be...
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,It nevertheless is.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Egerman!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Right! Score one for you.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A-ha!

A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"A weekend in the country,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,We should try it.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,How I wish we'd been asked.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"A weekend in the country,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Peace and quiet--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,We'll go masked.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country...
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Uninvited?
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,They'll consider it odd.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"A weekend in the country,"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,I'm delighted.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Oh, my god."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,And the shooting should be pleasant
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,If the weather's not too rough.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Happy birthday, it's your present."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,But--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,You haven't been getting out nearly enough.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,And a weekend in the country--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,It's perverted!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Pack my quiver and bow.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,A weekend in the country--
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"At exactly 2:30, we go."
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,We can't.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,We shall!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,We shan't!

A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,"Charlotte! Ma'am, it's wonderful news!"
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,I'm thinking it out. Are you sure it's all right?
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Charlotte! We'd be rude to refuse.
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,There's no need to shout. Then we're off!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,Charlotte!
A Little Night Music,A Weekend in the Country,We'll take the car!

A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),Oh.
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),"The atmosphere's becoming heady,"
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),The ambiance thrilling.
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),"The spirits unsteady,"
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),The flesh far from willing.
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),To be perpetually ready
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),Is far from fulfilling.
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),But wait! The sun is dipping.
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),Where?--You're right! It's dropping.
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),Look! At last it's slipping.
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),"Sorry, my mistake, it's stopping."
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),The light is pink
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),And the air is still
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),And the sun is slink-
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),Ing behind the hill.
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),"And when finally it sets,"
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),"As finally it must,"
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),When finally it lets
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),"The moon and stars adjust,"
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),When finally we greet the dark
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),"And we're breathing amen,"
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),"Surprise of surprises,"
A Little Night Music,The Sun Sits Low (Night Waltz II),It instantly rises
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Again.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,I should never have gone to the theatre.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Then I'd never have come to the country.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"If I never had come to the country,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Matters might have stayed as they were.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Sir...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Sir...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"If she'd only been faded,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"If she'd only been fat,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she'd only been jaded
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"And bursting with chat,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she'd only been perfectly awful
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,It would have been wonderful.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If...if...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she'd been all a-twitter
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Or elusively cold,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"If she'd only been bitter,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Or better, looked passably old,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she'd been covered with glitter
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Or even been covered with mold,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,It would have been wonderful.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"But the woman was perfection,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,To my deepest dismay.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Well, not quite perfection,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,I'm sorry to say.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"If the woman were perfection,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"She would go away,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,And that would be wonderful.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Sir...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Sir...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she'd only looked flustered
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Or admitted the worst,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she only had blustered
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Or simpered or cursed,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she weren't so awfully perfect
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,It would have been wonderful.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If...if...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"If she'd tried to be clever,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"If she'd started to flinch,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she'd cried or whatever
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"A woman would do in a pinch,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If I'd been certain she never
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Again could be trusted an inch,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,It would have been wonderful.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"But the woman was perfection,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Not an action denied,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,The kind of perfection
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,I cannot abide.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If the woman were perfection
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"She'd have simply lied,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Which would have been wonderful.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she'd only been vicious...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she'd acted abused...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Or a bit too delicious...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Or been even slightly confused...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she had only been sulky--
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Or bristling--
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Or bulky--
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Or bruised--
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,It would have been wonderful.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she'd only been wilful...
,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she only had fled...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Or a little less skillful...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Insulted, insisting--"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,In bed--
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,If she had only been fearful--
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Or married--
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Or tearful--
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Or dead--
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,It would have been wonderful.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"But the woman was perfection,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,And the prospects are grim;
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,That lovely perfection
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,That nothing can dim.
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,"Yes, the woman was perfection,"
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,So I'm here with him!
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Sir...
A Little Night Music,It Would Have Been Wonderful,Sir...
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,It would have been wonderful.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,But it's bad for the heart.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"It's very good for practicing self-control,"
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"It's very good for morals, but bad for morale."
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,It's very bad.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,It can lead to going quite mad.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,It's very good for reserve and learning to do what one should.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,It's very good.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"Perpetual anticipation's a delicate art,"
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"Playing a role,"
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"Aching to start,"
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,Keeping control
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,While falling apart.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,But it's bad for the heart.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,But it's bad for the heart.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"It's very good for practicing self-control,"
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"It's very good for morals, but bad for morale."
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,It's too unnerving.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"It's very good, though, to have things to contemplate."
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"Perpetual anticipation's a delicate art,"
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"Aching to start,"
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,Keeping control
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,While falling apart.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,But it's bad for the heart.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,But it's bad for the heart.
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"It's very good, though, to learn to wait."
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,"Perpetual anticipation's a delicate art,"
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,Keeping control
A Little Night Music,Perpetual Anticipation,While falling apart.
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Perpetual anticipation is bad for the heart.
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Isn't it rich?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Are we a pair?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"Me here at last on the ground,"
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,You in mid-air.
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Send in the clowns.
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Isn't it bliss?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Don't you approve?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"One who keeps tearing around,"
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,One who can't move.
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Where are the clowns?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Send in the clowns.
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"Just when I'd stopped opening doors,"
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours,"
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"Making my entrance again with my usual flair,"
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"Sure of my lines,"
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,No one is there.
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Don't you love farce?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"My fault, I fear."
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,I thought that you'd want what I want--
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"Sorry, my dear."
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,But where are the clowns?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"Quick, send in the clowns."
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,"Don't bother, they're here."
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Isn't it rich?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Isn't it queer?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,Losing my timing this late
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,In my career?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,And where are the clowns?
A Little Night Music,Send in the Clowns,There ought to be clowns.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"Well, maybe next year."
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"I shall marry the miller's son,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Pin my hat on a nice piece of property.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"Friday nights, for a bit of fun,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,We'll go dancing.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Meanwhile...
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,It's a wink and a wiggle and a giggle in the grass
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"And I'll trip the light fandango,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,A pinch and a diddle in the middle of what passes by.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,It's a very short road
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,From the pinch and the punch
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,To the paunch and the pouch
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And the pension.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,It's a very short road
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,To the ten thousandth lunch
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And the belch and the grouch
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And the sigh.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"In the meanwhile,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,There are mouths to be kissed
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"Before mouths to be fed,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And a lot in between
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,In the meanwhile.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And a girl ought to celebrate what passes by.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"Or I shall marry the businessman,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Five fat babies and lots of security.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"Friday nights, if we think we can,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,We'll go dancing.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Meanwhile...
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,It's a push and a fumble and a tumble in the sheets
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"And I'll foot the highland fancy,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,A dip in the butter and a flutter with what meets my eye.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,It's a very short fetch
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,From the push and the whoop
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,To the squint and the stoop
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And the mumble.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,It's not much of a stretch
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,To the cribs and the croup
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And the bosoms that droop
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And go dry.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"In the meanwhile,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,There are mouths to be kissed
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"Before mouths to be fed,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And there's many a tryst
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And there's many a bed
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,To be sampled and seen
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,In the meanwhile.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And a girl has to celebrate what passes by.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"Or I shall marry the Prince of Wales,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Pearls and servants and dressing for festivals.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"Friday nights, with him all in tails,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,We'll have dancing.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Meanwhile...
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,It's a rip in the bustle and a rustle in the hay
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"And I'll pitch the quick fantastic,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,With flings of confetti and my petticoats away up high.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,It's a very short way
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,From the fling that's for fun
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,To the thigh pressing un-
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Der the table.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,It's a very short day
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Till you're stuck with just one
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Or it has to be done
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,On the sly.
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"In the meanwhile,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,There are mouths to be kissed
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"Before mouths to be fed,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And there's many a tryst
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,"And there's many a bed,"
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,There's a lot I'll have missed
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,But I'll not have been dead
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,When I die!
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,And a person should celebrate everything
A Little Night Music,The Miller's Son,Passing by.
A Little Night Music,Finale,And I shall marry the miller's son...
A Little Night Music,Finale,Isn't it rich?
A Little Night Music,Finale,Are we a pair?
A Little Night Music,Finale,You here at last on the ground.
A Little Night Music,Finale,You in mid-air.
A Little Night Music,Finale,Was that a farce?
A Little Night Music,Finale,"My fault, I fear."
A Little Night Music,Finale,Me as a merry-go-round.
A Little Night Music,Finale,Me as King Lear.
A Little Night Music,Finale,Make way for the clowns.
A Little Night Music,Finale,Applause for the clowns.
A Little Night Music,Finale,They're finally here.
