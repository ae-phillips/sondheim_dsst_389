Passion,Happiness,I'm so happy
Passion,Happiness,I'm afraid I'll die
Passion,Happiness,Here in your arms
Passion,Happiness,What would you do
Passion,Happiness,If I died
Passion,Happiness,Like this
Passion,Happiness,Right now
Passion,Happiness,Here in your arms?
Passion,Happiness,That we ever should have met
Passion,Happiness,Is a miracle
Passion,Happiness,"No, inevitable—"
Passion,Happiness,"Then inevitable, yes"
Passion,Happiness,But I confess
Passion,Happiness,It was the look—
Passion,Happiness,The look?
Passion,Happiness,The sadness in your eyes
Passion,Happiness,That day
Passion,Happiness,When we glanced
Passion,Happiness,At each other in the park
Passion,Happiness,We were both unhappy
Passion,Happiness,Unhappiness can be seductive
Passion,Happiness,You pitied me
Passion,Happiness,How quickly pity leads to love
Passion,Happiness,All this happiness
Passion,Happiness,Merely from a glance in the park
Passion,Happiness,So much happiness
Passion,Happiness,So much love
Passion,Happiness,I thought I knew what love was
Passion,Happiness,I wish we might have met so much sooner
Passion,Happiness,I could have given you—
Passion,Happiness,I thought I knew what love was
Passion,Happiness,—My youth
Passion,Happiness,I thought I knew how much I could feel
Passion,Happiness,All the time we lost...
Passion,Happiness,I didn't know what love was
Passion,Happiness,I've never known what love was
Passion,Happiness,But now—
Passion,Happiness,"
And now—"
Passion,Happiness,— I do
Passion,Happiness,It's what I feel with you
Passion,Happiness,The happiness I feel with you
Passion,Happiness,So much happiness
Passion,Happiness,Happening by chance in a park
Passion,Happiness,"Surely, this is happiness"
Passion,Happiness,No one else has ever felt before!
Passion,Happiness,You are so beautiful...
Passion,Happiness,Not by chance
Passion,Happiness,By necessity
Passion,Happiness,By the sadness that we saw in each other.
Passion,Happiness,Just another love story
Passion,Happiness,That's what they would claim
Passion,Happiness,Another simple love story
Passion,Happiness,Aren't all of them the same?
Passion,Happiness,"No, but this is more"
Passion,Happiness,We feel more!
Passion,Happiness,This is so much more!
Passion,Happiness,Like every other love story
Passion,Happiness,Some say happiness
Passion,Happiness,Comes and goes
Passion,Happiness,Then this happiness
Passion,Happiness,Is a kind of happiness
Passion,Happiness,No one really knows
Passion,Happiness,I thought I knew what love was
Passion,Happiness,I'd only heard what love was
Passion,Happiness,I thought it was no more than a name for yearning
Passion,Happiness,I thought it was what kindness became
Passion,Happiness,I'm learning
Passion,Happiness,I thought where there was love there was shame
Passion,Happiness,That with you
Passion,Happiness,But with you
Passion,Happiness,There's just happiness
Passion,Happiness,Endless happiness...
Passion,Happiness,What?
Passion,Happiness,I've been transferred to the Fourth Brigade
Passion,Happiness,"Oh, Clara, please don't look so sad"
Passion,Happiness,You're the one that makes me happy
Passion,Happiness,"God, you are so beautiful"
Passion,Happiness,I love to see you in the light
Passion,Happiness,"Clear and beautiful, memorize"
Passion,Happiness,Every inch
Passion,Happiness,Every part of you
Passion,Happiness,To take with me
Passion,Happiness,Giorgio...
Passion,Happiness,Your feet so soft
Passion,Happiness,As if they'd never touched the ground
Passion,Happiness,I must go...
Passion,Happiness,"Your skin so white, so pure, so delicate"
Passion,Happiness,"Your smell so sweet, your breathe so warm"
Passion,Happiness,I will summon you in my mind
Passion,Happiness,I'm painting you indelibly on my mind
Passion,Happiness,Let me go
Passion,Happiness,We must fill every moment
Passion,Happiness,All this happiness ended by a word in the dark
Passion,Happiness,"Oh my love, oh my darling"
Passion,Happiness,So much happiness wasn't meant to last
Passion,Happiness,I am here
Passion,Happiness,I am with you
Passion,Happiness,I am yours
Passion,Happiness,I never knew what love was
Passion,Happiness,Your skin
Passion,Happiness,Your silken hair
Passion,Happiness,"Your breasts, your lips"
Passion,Happiness,I want you every minute of my life
Passion,Happiness,I will always be here
Passion,Happiness,I always thought I didn't deserve it
Passion,Happiness,I didn't know what love was
Passion,Happiness,I don't know how I'll live when you're gone!
Passion,Happiness,I don't know how I'll live
Passion,Happiness,Giorgio!
Passion,Happiness,Don't leave me
Passion,First Letter,Clara...
Passion,First Letter,Clara...
Passion,First Letter,I cried
Passion,First Letter,I cried
Passion,First Letter,"Imagine that, a soldier who cries"
Passion,First Letter,"I had to hide my eyes, so the others on the train"
Passion,First Letter,That carried me away from you would think I was asleep
Passion,First Letter,Music?
Passion,First Letter,That's Signora Fosca playing
Passion,First Letter,"My cousin. She is in such poor health, it's a continual worry"
Passion,First Letter,"She stays in her room most days, reading"
Passion,First Letter,I can't find enough books for her
Passion,First Letter,"I also love to read. I've brought a few of my favorite ones, I'd be most happy to lend them to Signora Fosca, though I can't promise they will appeal to her"
Passion,First Letter,"Captain, my cousin's been driven to reading military handbooks. I've no doubt she will welcome anything in print"
Passion,Second Letter,Giorgio
Passion,Second Letter,I too have cried
Passion,Second Letter,Inside
Passion,Second Letter,You must not be ashamed of your tears
Passion,Second Letter,I love you for your tears
Passion,Second Letter,Your absence only makes my love grow stronger
Passion,Second Letter,And when I cannot bear it any longer
Passion,Second Letter,"Don't be alarmed, it's my cousin. I'm so accustomed to her outbursts that I forget how unsettling they are to a newcomer"
Passion,Third Letter,"""Clara, I'm in hell"""
Passion,Third Letter,This is hell
Passion,Third Letter,Living hell
Passion,Third Letter,"""Living hell"
Passion,Third Letter,"This godforsaken place"""
Passion,Third Letter,Godforsaken place
Passion,Third Letter,"""This sterile little town"
Passion,Third Letter,"These pompous little men"""
Passion,Third Letter,This military madness
Passion,Third Letter,This military madness
Passion,Third Letter,This military
Passion,Third Letter,"Uniforms, uniforms"
Passion,Third Letter,Military madness
Passion,Third Letter,This military madness
Passion,Third Letter,My days are spent in maneuvers
Passion,Third Letter,"Uniforms, uniforms"
Passion,Third Letter,My evenings in discussing the day
Passion,Third Letter,This is hell!
Passion,Third Letter,"""My nights are spent in thinking of you"""
Passion,Third Letter,"Don't forget me, Clara"
Passion,Fourth Letter,How could I forget you?
Passion,Fourth Letter,Yesterday I walked through the park
Passion,Fourth Letter,To the knoll where we met
Passion,Fourth Letter,Afterwards I sat on the bench
Passion,Fourth Letter,Where we sat all that sultry afternoon
Passion,Fourth Letter,"I thought about our room, our little room"
Passion,Fourth Letter,Where we were happy
Passion,Fourth Letter,And where we shall be happy again
Passion,Fourth Letter,Some day
Passion,Fourth Letter,"I see us in our room, our little room"
Passion,Fourth Letter,And I don't feel so alone any more
Passion,Fourth Letter,"I close my eyes, imagining that you are there"
Passion,Fourth Letter,Imagining your fingers touching mine
Passion,Fourth Letter,Imagining our room
Passion,Fourth Letter,"The bed, the secrecy, the world outside"
Passion,Fourth Letter,Your mouth on mine
Passion,Fourth Letter,Captain...
Passion,I Read,I hope I didn't startle you
Passion,I Read,"Not at all. Signora Ricci, I'm Captain Bachetti–"
Passion,I Read,–Bachetti
Passion,I Read,I know. My cousin has told me all about you
Passion,I Read,I came to thank you for the books
Passion,I Read,"I would have sooner, but I've been so ill"
Passion,I Read,"Well, now you seem to be feeling more normal"
Passion,I Read,Normal? I hardly think so. Sickness is normal to me as health is to you
Passion,I Read,Excuse me. I shouldn't speak of my troubles. I've been going through a period of deep melancholy
Passion,I Read,I so enjoyed the novel by Rousseau
Passion,I Read,"Oh, it's wonderful. My favorite, really"
Passion,I Read,The character of Julie is a great mystery
Passion,I Read,You should have kept the book longer to meditate over
Passion,I Read,I do not read to think
Passion,I Read,I do not read to learn
Passion,I Read,I do not read to search for truth
Passion,I Read,"I know the truth, the truth is hardly what I need"
Passion,I Read,I read to dream
Passion,I Read,I read to live
Passion,I Read,In other people's lives
Passion,I Read,I read about the joys the world
Passion,I Read,Dispenses to the fortunate
Passion,I Read,And listen for the echoes
Passion,I Read,I read to live
Passion,I Read,To get away from life!
Passion,I Read,"No, captain, I have no illusions"
Passion,I Read,I recognize the limits of my dreams
Passion,I Read,I know how painful dreams can be
Passion,I Read,Unless you know they're merely dreams
Passion,I Read,There is a flower
Passion,I Read,Which offers nectar at the top
Passion,I Read,Delicious nectar at the top
Passion,I Read,And bitter poison underneath
Passion,I Read,The butterfly that stays too long and drinks too deep
Passion,I Read,Is doomed to die
Passion,I Read,I read to fly
Passion,I Read,To skim
Passion,I Read,I do not read to swim
Passion,I Read,I do not dwell on dreams
Passion,I Read,I know how soon a dream becomes an expectation
Passion,I Read,How can I have expectations?
Passion,I Read,Look at me
Passion,I Read,"No, captain, look at me"
Passion,I Read,Look at me!
Passion,I Read,I do not hope for what I cannot have!
Passion,I Read,I do not cling to things I cannot keep!
Passion,I Read,"The more you cling to things, the more you love them"
Passion,I Read,The more the pain you suffer when they're taken from you
Passion,I Read,"Ah, but if you have no expectations, Captain"
Passion,I Read,You can never have a disappointment
Passion,I Read,"I must be mad to chatter on about myself like this to you, forgive me"
Passion,I Read,I assure you–
Passion,I Read,"No, forgive me, please"
Passion,I Read,"But truly, there is nothing to forgive–"
Passion,I Read,Have you explored the town?
Passion,I Read,It is remote
Passion,I Read,Isn't it?
Passion,I Read,"And provincial, don't you think?"
Passion,I Read,Yes
Passion,I Read,And everything so brown:
Passion,I Read,"The streets, the fields, the river even"
Passion,I Read,Though there are some lovely gardens
Passion,I Read,"You do like gardens, I hope?"
Passion,I Read,Yes
Passion,I Read,"Good, I can show you gardens"
Passion,I Read,And then of course there is the castle
Passion,I Read,The ruined castle
Passion,I Read,Ah
Passion,I Read,"I find it lovely. Probably because it's ruined, I suppose"
Passion,I Read,I didn't know there was a castle
Passion,I Read,I like to take excursions there
Passion,I Read,When I'm in better health
Passion,I Read,Perhaps you'll join me
Passion,I Read,And my cousin
Passion,I Read,One day...
Passion,I Read,That would be delightful. I don't believe I've seen a flower or a garden since the day I arrived
Passion,Transition (#1),How can I describe her
Passion,Transition (#1),The wretchedness
Passion,Transition (#1),"God, the wretchedness"
Passion,Transition (#1),And the suffering
Passion,Transition (#1),The desperation
Passion,Transition (#1),"Of that poor, unhappy creature"
Passion,Transition (#1),"The embarrassment, Clara"
Passion,Transition (#1),Looking at the loneliness
Passion,Transition (#1),Listening to all that self-pity
Passion,Transition (#1),The town
Passion,Transition (#1),It is remote
Passion,Transition (#1),Isn't it?
Passion,Transition (#1),And provincial
Passion,Transition (#1),Don't you think?
Passion,Transition (#1),And everything's so brown
Passion,Transition (#1),The streets
Passion,Transition (#1),The fields
Passion,Transition (#1),"The river, even"
Passion,Transition (#1),Of course there is the castle
Passion,Transition (#1),The ruined castle
Passion,Garden Sequence,"Ah, look at how they've let this garden go"
Passion,Garden Sequence,"This is not Milan, Doctor"
Passion,Garden Sequence,I think it's rather beautiful
Passion,Garden Sequence,"Captain Bachetti, would you lend my cousin your arm? I wish to have a word with the Doctor"
Passion,Garden Sequence,Of course
Passion,Garden Sequence,I know how to walk. My cousin treats me like a child
Passion,Garden Sequence,"All the while as we strolled, Clara-"
Passion,Garden Sequence,I hope I didn't frighten you the other day
Passion,Garden Sequence,"No, not at all"
Passion,Garden Sequence,I could see you reading my letter
Passion,Garden Sequence,All the while as we strolled -
Passion,Garden Sequence,"I'm not afraid of death. I rather think I'd welcome dying. It's being shut up in a coffin, covered by the earth, that I dread"
Passion,Garden Sequence,"All I saw, all I knew"
Passion,Garden Sequence,All that I could think of was you
Passion,Garden Sequence,All that I could think of was you
Passion,Garden Sequence,How ridiculous
Passion,Garden Sequence,To be looking at her
Passion,Garden Sequence,And be thinking of you
Passion,Garden Sequence,How could anyone
Passion,Garden Sequence,So unbeautiful
Passion,Garden Sequence,Stir my memory of you?
Passion,Garden Sequence,To feel a woman's touch
Passion,Garden Sequence,To touch a woman's hand
Passion,Garden Sequence,Reminded me how much I long to be with you
Passion,Garden Sequence,How long I've been without you near
Passion,Garden Sequence,And then to hear a woman's voice
Passion,Garden Sequence,To hold a woman's arm
Passion,Garden Sequence,To feel a woman's touch...
Passion,Garden Sequence,"These thoughts are bad for you. Surely if you are sick, you must realize that there is also the hope that you will get better"
Passion,Garden Sequence,Hope in my case is in short supply
Passion,Garden Sequence,Uld somehow make one happy
Passion,Garden Sequence,Perhaps it was the dress
Passion,Garden Sequence,The fragrance of her dress
Passion,Garden Sequence,The light perfume of silk
Passion,Garden Sequence,That's warm from being in the sun
Passion,Garden Sequence,That mingles with a woman's own perfume
Passion,Garden Sequence,The fragrance of a woman...
Passion,Garden Sequence,"There is no absolute happiness in anyone's life, Signora"
Passion,Garden Sequence,The only happiness we can be certain of is love
Passion,Garden Sequence,The garden filled with you-
Passion,Garden Sequence,Are you speaking of friendships?
Passion,Garden Sequence,I'm speaking of a superior love
Passion,Garden Sequence,And all that I could do
Passion,Garden Sequence,Because of you
Passion,Garden Sequence,Was talk of love
Passion,Garden Sequence,Love that fills every waking moment
Passion,Garden Sequence,Love that grows every single day
Passion,Garden Sequence,Love that thinks everything is pure
Passion,Garden Sequence,Everything is beautiful
Passion,Garden Sequence,Everything is possible
Passion,Garden Sequence,Love that fuses two into one
Passion,Garden Sequence,Where we think the same thoughts
Passion,Garden Sequence,Want the same things
Passion,Garden Sequence,Live as one
Passion,Garden Sequence,Feel as one
Passion,Garden Sequence,Breathe as one
Passion,Garden Sequence,Love that shuts away the world
Passion,Garden Sequence,Love that shuts away the world
Passion,Garden Sequence,That envelops my soul
Passion,Garden Sequence,That envelops your soul
Passion,Garden Sequence,That ennobles my life
Passion,Garden Sequence,Your life
Passion,Garden Sequence,Love that floods
Passion,Garden Sequence,Every living moment
Passion,Garden Sequence,Love like
Passion,Garden Sequence,-ours
Passion,Garden Sequence,Love like-?
Passion,Garden Sequence,-like wine
Passion,Garden Sequence,An intoxication
Passion,Garden Sequence,"A great blindness, if you will"
Passion,Garden Sequence,"You can be incredibly cruel, Captain"
Passion,Garden Sequence,Cruel?
Passion,Garden Sequence,To speak to me of love
Passion,Garden Sequence,"Oh, forgive me! I didn't mean to-"
Passion,Garden Sequence,To dangle words like
Passion,Garden Sequence,"""Happiness"""
Passion,Garden Sequence,"""Beautiful"""
Passion,Garden Sequence,"""Superior"""
Passion,Garden Sequence,You can't be that naive
Passion,Garden Sequence,You with all your books
Passion,Garden Sequence,"Your taste, your sensitivity"
Passion,Garden Sequence,I thought you'd understand
Passion,Garden Sequence,"The others - well, they're all alike"
Passion,Garden Sequence,Stupidity is their excuse
Passion,Garden Sequence,As ugliness is mine
Passion,Garden Sequence,But what is yours?
Passion,Garden Sequence,I've watched you from my window
Passion,Garden Sequence,I saw you on the day that you arrived
Passion,Garden Sequence,Perhaps it was the way you walked
Passion,Garden Sequence,The way you spoke to your men
Passion,Garden Sequence,I saw that you were different then
Passion,Garden Sequence,I saw that you were kind and good
Passion,Garden Sequence,I thought you understood
Passion,Garden Sequence,They hear drums
Passion,Garden Sequence,You hear music
Passion,Garden Sequence,As do I
Passion,Garden Sequence,Don't you see?
Passion,Garden Sequence,We're the same
Passion,Garden Sequence,We are different
Passion,Garden Sequence,You and I are different
Passion,Garden Sequence,They hear only drums
Passion,Garden Sequence,All the time I watched from my room
Passion,Garden Sequence,I would think of coming downstairs
Passion,Garden Sequence,Thinking we'd meet
Passion,Garden Sequence,Thinking you'd look at me
Passion,Garden Sequence,Thinking you'd be repelled by what you saw
Passion,Garden Sequence,Don't reject me
Passion,Garden Sequence,"Don't deny me, Captain"
Passion,Garden Sequence,"Understand me, be my friend"
Passion,Garden Sequence,"They hear drums, we hear music"
Passion,Garden Sequence,Be my friend...
Passion,Transition (#2),All the time I watched
Passion,Transition (#2),From my room
Passion,Transition (#2),Thinking we'd meet
Passion,Transition (#2),Thinking you'd look at me
Passion,Transition (#2),Thinking you'd
Passion,Transition (#2),Be repelled by what you saw
Passion,Transition (#2),Don't reject me
Passion,Transition (#2),Don't deny me
Passion,Transition (#2),Understand me; be my friend
Passion,Transition (#2),They hear drums; we hear music
Passion,Transition (#2),Be my friend
Passion,Transition (#2),What are you doing up and out at this hour?
Passion,Transition (#2),When will you be back?
Passion,Transition (#2),You know I have a five day leave. I must go
Passion,Transition (#2),Write me!
Passion,Transition (#2),"Fine, I'll write you..."
Passion,Transition (#2),Promise!
Passion,Transition (#2),"Yes, I promise"
Passion,Transition (#2),Tomorrow?
Passion,Transition (#2),"Tomorrow. Go, I want no one to see you here"
Passion,Transition (#2),Bless you
Passion,Trio,"I am writing to you, Signora"
Passion,Trio,Just as soon as I've arrived
Passion,Trio,With a most unhappy heart
Passion,Trio,I do not wish
Passion,Trio,To cause you pain
Passion,Trio,So please consider what I say
Passion,Trio,With calm
Passion,Trio,My heart
Passion,Trio,My heart belongs
Passion,Trio,My heart belongs to someone else
Passion,Trio,I am in love
Passion,Trio,Hopelessly in love
Passion,Trio,Hopelessly in love
Passion,Trio,And am loved
Passion,Trio,"Hopelessly in turn, Signora"
Passion,Trio,You and I
Passion,Trio,We're not meant for each other
Passion,Trio,If I seemed to imply
Passion,Trio,Something more
Passion,Trio,I apologize
Passion,Trio,But since we're forced to be together
Passion,Trio,Let us try to face the fact
Passion,Trio,Let us both behave with tact
Passion,Trio,If this letter seems cold-hearted
Passion,Trio,It conceals my own distress
Passion,Trio,Nonetheless
Passion,Trio,We must end what never started
Passion,Trio,You must recognize
Passion,Trio,There is nothing between us
Passion,Trio,Nothing
Passion,Trio,Nothing
Passion,Trio,Nothing
Passion,Trio,God
Passion,Trio,You are so beautiful
Passion,Trio,As I remember every night
Passion,Trio,Clear and beautiful
Passion,Trio,"Every night, every day"
Passion,Trio,Every part of you
Passion,Trio,You feel so good
Passion,Trio,As if you'd never been away
Passion,Trio,Your breath so warm
Passion,Trio,Your touch so sure
Passion,Trio,Your skin so delicate
Passion,Trio,Your arms so strong
Passion,Trio,All this happiness
Passion,Trio,Being here with you in the dark
Passion,Trio,So much happiness
Passion,Trio,Even more than what I felt before!
Passion,Trio,To feel your touch again
Passion,Trio,When so much time has passed
Passion,Trio,To dream of you and then
Passion,Trio,To be with you again
Passion,Trio,And have some time at last
Passion,Trio,How long were we apart
Passion,Trio,"A month, a week, a day?"
Passion,Trio,To feel your touch again
Passion,Trio,You've never been away
Passion,Trio,"Still, I've missed you"
Passion,Trio,So much
Passion,Trio,I'm here now
Passion,Trio,Welcome home
Passion,Transition (#3),I've watched you from my window
Passion,Transition (#3),I saw you on the day that you arrived
Passion,Transition (#3),Perhaps it was the way you walked
Passion,Transition (#3),The way you spoke to your men
Passion,Transition (#3),You were different then
Passion,Transition (#3),You were kind and good
Passion,Transition (#3),I thought you understood
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,"Fosca, it will be light soon, I should be going."
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Would you do me a great favor before you leave?
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Would you write a letter for me?
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Certainly.
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,My dearest... Fosca.
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Please.
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,"""My dearest Fosca..."""
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I wish I could forget you
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Erase you from my mind
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,But ever since I met you
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I find
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I cannot leave the thought of you behind
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,That doesn't mean I love you...
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,"""That doesn't mean I love you..."""
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I wish that I could love you...
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I know that I've upset you
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I know I've been unkind
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I wanted you to vanish from sight
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,But now I see you in a different light
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,And though I cannot love you
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I wish that I could love you
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,For now I'm seeing love
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Like none I've ever known
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,A love as pure as breath
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,As permanent as death
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Implacable as stone
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,A love that like a knife
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Has cut into a life
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I wanted left alone
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,A love I may regret
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,But one I can't forget
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I don't know how I let you
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,So far inside my mind
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,But there you are and there you will stay
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,How could I ever wish you away?
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I see now I was blind
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,And should you die tomorrow
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Another thing I see:
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Your love will live in me
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,I remain...
Passion,I Wish I Could Forget You,Your Giorgio.
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Did you hear the scream last night?
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Did anybody not?
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Four ball on the side
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"She knows how to scream, all right"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"Well, she practices a lot"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Good shot
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Six ball in the corner
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"So that wasn't dying, we assume?"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"No, I think she just fell off her broom"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Or they hung a mirror in the room
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Of La Signora!
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),La Signora!
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),La Signora!
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"Please, a little quiet!"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"Care to play, Captain?"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),No. Thank you for asking
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"Just a bit aloof, don't you think?"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Not around the Colonel
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"Gentlemen, gentlemen!"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Never trust a man who doesn't drink
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),And he keeps a journal
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Eight-ball off the nine
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"Maybe, though, he just prefers his books"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Not as much as he prefers his looks
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Which is why he thinks he's got his hooks
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),Into La Signora
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"Gentlemen, I'll make a wager:"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),"Come the summer, he'll be Major"
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),I'll say!
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),I'll say!
Passion,Soldiers' Gossip (#1),I'll say!
Passion,Flashback,"Captain, I cannot thank you enough. Your kindness to my cousin has meant a great deal"
Passion,Flashback,You have no reason to thank me
Passion,Flashback,Any attention that is paid to her means so much. Signora Fosca has always had a shortage of friends
Passion,Flashback,My dearest Giorgio. I am writing you even though the Doctor has forbidden it. What a joy to have someone to whom I can tell my feelings. To share my past
Passion,Flashback,"I was a young man when my parents died, and Fosca's mother and father welcomed me into their house whenever I was on leave"
Passion,Flashback,As a child
Passion,Flashback,As a child
Passion,Flashback,She was lonely
Passion,Flashback,I was happy
Passion,Flashback,Her parеnts doted on her
Passion,Flashback,My parents dotеd on me
Passion,Flashback,They said:
Passion,Flashback,Beautiful
Passion,Flashback,So sensitive
Passion,Flashback,So beautiful
Passion,Flashback,They told me to be:
Passion,Flashback,Careful
Passion,Flashback,Of course
Passion,Flashback,Fosca
Passion,Flashback,"To them, she was"
Passion,Flashback,A girl as beautiful as you are has to
Passion,Flashback,And so
Passion,Flashback,Be careful
Passion,Flashback,I thought
Passion,Flashback,That I was beautiful
Passion,Flashback,And then she (I) reached the age
Passion,Flashback,Where being beautiful
Passion,Flashback,Becomes the most important thing
Passion,Flashback,A woman can be
Passion,Flashback,An unattractive man
Passion,Flashback,As long as you're a man
Passion,Flashback,You still have opportunities
Passion,Flashback,Can still have opportunities
Passion,Flashback,Beautiful...
Passion,Flashback,"Whereas, if you're a woman"
Passion,Flashback,You either are a daughter or a wife
Passion,Flashback,A woman is a flower
Passion,Flashback,You marry
Passion,Flashback,You're seventeen
Passion,Flashback,Or you're a daughter all your life
Passion,Flashback,Now is the hour...
Passion,Flashback,I'd met this nice young man
Passion,Flashback,I'd seen this nice young man
Passion,Flashback,He'd introduced himself
Passion,Flashback,Passing by
Passion,Flashback,At my club
Passion,Flashback,Just below my window
Passion,Flashback,So
Passion,Flashback,One day
Passion,Flashback,One evening I invited him
Passion,Flashback,He tipped his hat to me
Passion,Flashback,Home
Passion,Flashback,Count Ludovic!
Passion,Flashback,I must admit that I was flattered
Passion,Flashback,This is my Aunt Teresa and my Uncle Bruno
Passion,Flashback,A count?
Passion,Flashback,"From where, if I may ask?"
Passion,Flashback,Austria
Passion,Flashback,Austria...
Passion,Flashback,What a beautiful place
Passion,Flashback,"Fosca, we have a visitor!"
Passion,Flashback,Imagine my surprise
Passion,Flashback,"I'd like you to meet a new friend, Count Ludovic!"
Passion,Flashback,He was even more handsome up close
Passion,Flashback,I was amazed to see the count take such an interest in my cousin
Passion,Flashback,"If I had known you were here, Signorina-"
Passion,Flashback,"""If he had known,"" of course he knew"
Passion,Flashback,I would have brought you many flowers
Passion,Flashback,If I had known...
Passion,Flashback,You do like flowers?
Passion,Flashback,Yes
Passion,Flashback,I should have known
Passion,Flashback,I've seen you at your window
Passion,Flashback,Won't you stay for dinner?
Passion,Flashback,"Do, yes"
Passion,Flashback,I've watched you every day since I arrived
Passion,Flashback,I had my suspicions
Passion,Flashback,I had no suspicion
Passion,Flashback,I chose not to see
Passion,Flashback,The way you move
Passion,Flashback,The way you gaze at the sky
Passion,Flashback,For love had made me blind
Passion,Flashback,How could I be so blind?
Passion,Flashback,Or what I took for love
Passion,Flashback,"Within a month, he had asked for her hand"
Passion,Flashback,Signora Fosca has been married?
Passion,Flashback,Yes
Passion,Flashback,"Austria, Count Ludovic of Austria"
Passion,Flashback,I sensed in him a danger
Passion,Flashback,"Deception, even violence"
Passion,Flashback,"I must admit, to some degree"
Passion,Flashback,That it excited me
Passion,Flashback,"Austria, Count Ludovic of Austria"
Passion,Flashback,"Once they were married, once he'd received my uncle's sizable dowry, he traveled a great deal, was unavailable to Fosca"
Passion,Flashback,He gambled away the dowry. I was forced to go to my parents to borrow from what little savings they had left
Passion,Flashback,"Then, one day, as she was coming from market..."
Passion,Flashback,Excuse me. You're the wife of a Count Ludovic?
Passion,Flashback,Yes
Passion,Flashback,You fool
Passion,Flashback,"The man's a fraud, a fake"
Passion,Flashback,The trips he said he had to take abroad
Passion,Flashback,He took them so he could be with me
Passion,Flashback,"He calls himself a count, but he's not"
Passion,Flashback,He's never had a title in his life!
Passion,Flashback,He doesn't have a title
Passion,Flashback,But he does have a wife
Passion,Flashback,And a child in Dalmatia
Passion,Flashback,"No, you must be mistaken"
Passion,Flashback,"Oh, yes"
Passion,Flashback,He only wants to bleed you
Passion,Flashback,Until the day he doesn't need you
Passion,Flashback,I warn you he'll abandon you
Passion,Flashback,As he abandoned her and me
Passion,Flashback,"And countless others, I've no doubt"
Passion,Flashback,"I'm telling you, the man was born without a heart"
Passion,Flashback,You fool...
Passion,Flashback,"I confronted him with this information, and he made no attempt to deny it"
Passion,Flashback,"Ah well, at last you know the truth, Signorina"
Passion,Flashback,"But you, as well, must face the truth"
Passion,Flashback,I've no desire to deceive you anymore
Passion,Flashback,But do admit what you ignore:
Passion,Flashback,"We made a bargain, did we not?"
Passion,Flashback,And we got what we bargained for
Passion,Flashback,"You gave me your money, I gave you my looks"
Passion,Flashback,And my charm and my arm
Passion,Flashback,I would say that more than balances the books
Passion,Flashback,Where's the harm?
Passion,Flashback,Now it's through
Passion,Flashback,If women sell their looks
Passion,Flashback,"Why can't a man, if he can?"
Passion,Flashback,"Besides, the money wasn't even yours"
Passion,Flashback,It belonged to those ridiculous old bores
Passion,Flashback,Your parents
Passion,Flashback,"Forgive me, my dear, but though you are no cutie"
Passion,Flashback,I fear you are not quite the victim you appear
Passion,Flashback,"Well, let us part by mutual consent and be content"
Passion,Flashback,"And so, good luck and goodbye"
Passion,Flashback,I must go
Passion,Flashback,"Oh, and yes, we haven't paid the rent"
Passion,Flashback,Since July
Passion,Flashback,Just so you know...
Passion,Flashback,I returned home to find my parents impoverished and in poor health
Passion,Flashback,Fosca's health failed
Passion,Flashback,A woman's like a flower
Passion,Flashback,She began to suffer her first convulsions. My aunt and uncle nursed her as best they could
Passion,Flashback,A flower's only purpose is to please
Passion,Flashback,I spent months looking for the man
Passion,Flashback,Beauty is power
Passion,Flashback,"By then, of course, he'd vanished"
Passion,Flashback,"Longing, a disease"
Passion,Flashback,"To this day, I dream of finding him and realizing my revenge"
Passion,Flashback,My father died not long thereafter
Passion,Flashback,How could I be so blind?
Passion,Flashback,I couldn't face the world
Passion,Flashback,It took her many months to leave her bed
Passion,Flashback,It took me months to leave my bed
Passion,Flashback,"When her mother died, she had nothing, really. No one"
Passion,Flashback,"And so, I went to stay with my cousin, who in some way felt responsible for my circumstances"
Passion,Flashback,Why could I not admit the truth?
Passion,Flashback,How could I not have seen through the veneer?
Passion,Flashback,I told myself
Passion,Flashback,"""As long as she seems happy, why interfere?"""
Passion,Flashback,Or was I just relieved to know
Passion,Flashback,That somebody would want her for a wife?
Passion,Flashback,"In war, you know the enemy"
Passion,Flashback,Not always so in life
Passion,Flashback,The enemy was love
Passion,Flashback,"Selfishness, really, but love"
Passion,Flashback,All of us blinded by love
Passion,Flashback,That makes everything seem possible
Passion,Flashback,You have to pay a consequence
Passion,Flashback,For things that you've denied
Passion,Flashback,This is the thorn in my side
Passion,Flashback,As long as you're a man
Passion,Flashback,You're what the world will make of you
Passion,Flashback,"Whereas, if you're a woman"
Passion,Flashback,You're only what it sees
Passion,Flashback,A woman is a flower whose purpose is to please
Passion,Flashback,"Beauty is power, longing, a disease"
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Giorgio
Passion,Sunrise Letter,I stand here staring at the sunrise
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Thinking how we've never seen a sunrise
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Together
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Thinking that the sunrise only means another day
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Without you
Passion,Sunrise Letter,And thinking can our love survive
Passion,Sunrise Letter,So much separation
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Keep itself alive
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Much less thrive?
Passion,Sunrise Letter,If only you were here
Passion,Sunrise Letter,If I could feel your touch
Passion,Sunrise Letter,I wouldn't have such fear
Passion,Sunrise Letter,If only we had more than letters
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Holding us together
Passion,Sunrise Letter,If we just could hold each other
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Now the sunrise then could be
Passion,Sunrise Letter,A thing that I could see
Passion,Sunrise Letter,And merely think how beautiful
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Giorgio
Passion,Sunrise Letter,I now sit staring at the mirror
Passion,Sunrise Letter,You may not believe it but
Passion,Sunrise Letter,"I swear, as I stare, there it is, plain as day: a grey hair"
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Of which I was unaware
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Which is more than I can bear
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Which I'm ripping out right now
Passion,Sunrise Letter,And am sending on to you
Passion,Sunrise Letter,As a milestone of my age
Passion,Sunrise Letter,As a turning of the page
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Perhaps when next we meet
Passion,Sunrise Letter,I'll be a sorry sight
Passion,Sunrise Letter,You won't know who I am
Passion,Sunrise Letter,My hair completely white
Passion,Sunrise Letter,"My face, a mass of wrinkles"
Passion,Sunrise Letter,What will you feel then?
Passion,Sunrise Letter,My Giorgio:
Passion,Sunrise Letter,Time is now our enemy!
Passion,Sunrise Letter,You came a great distance to read her letters
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Is this what you call love?
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,This endless and insatiable
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Smothering pursuit of me
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,You think that this is love?
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,I'm sorry that you're lonely
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,I'm sorry that you want me as you do
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,I'm sorry that I fail to feel
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,The way you wish me to feel
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,I'm sorry that you're ill
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,I'm sorry you're in pain
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,I'm sorry that you aren't beautiful
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,"But yes, I wish you'd go away"
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,And leave me alone!
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,"Everywhere I turn, there you are"
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,"This is not love, but some kind of obsession"
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Will you never learn when too far is too far?
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,"Have you no concern for what I feel, what I want?"
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Love is what you earn
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,And return
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,When you care for another
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,So much that the other's set free
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Don't you see?
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Can't you understand?
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Love's not a constant demand
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,It's a gift you bestow
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Love isn't sudden surrender
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,It's tender and slow
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,It must grow!
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Yet everywhere I go
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,You appear or I know you are near
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,"This is not love, just a need for possession"
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,Call it what you will
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,"This is not love, this is the reverse"
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,"Like a curse, something out of control"
Passion,Is This What You Call Love?,I've begun to fear for my soul!

Passion,Farewell Letter,"I am writing to you, my angel"
Passion,Farewell Letter,Though not long since you've been gone
Passion,Farewell Letter,With a most unhappy heart
Passion,Farewell Letter,"Because in truth, as time goes on"
Passion,Farewell Letter,I think of nothing else but you
Passion,Farewell Letter,And us
Passion,Farewell Letter,"Oh my love, my sweet, you've changed"
Passion,Farewell Letter,I've watched you change
Passion,Farewell Letter,You're not the man I thought I knew
Passion,Farewell Letter,At times these past few days together
Passion,Farewell Letter,I would wonder whether you were here
Passion,Farewell Letter,Really here with me
Passion,Farewell Letter,I thought was I naïve
Passion,Farewell Letter,To believe
Passion,Farewell Letter,We'd continue year by year
Passion,Farewell Letter,Is it over forever?
Passion,Farewell Letter,"When my son is older, when he goes off to school, there is the chance for us to be together. Will you wait for me, Giorgio? I have to know. We both have to know"
Passion,Farewell Letter,All that happiness
Passion,Farewell Letter,In the past
Passion,Farewell Letter,That was not just happiness
Passion,Farewell Letter,Love was in that happiness
Passion,Farewell Letter,That's why it will last
Passion,Farewell Letter,I thought I knew what love was
Passion,Farewell Letter,I didn't know that love was a complication
Passion,Farewell Letter,We'll take it in our stride
Passion,Farewell Letter,You decide
Passion,Farewell Letter,We could have everything
Passion,Farewell Letter,I want you more than anything
Passion,Farewell Letter,To wait is nothing

Passion,Farewell Letter,Nothing
Passion,Farewell Letter,It was mine
Passion,Farewell Letter,It was yours; you were mine
Passion,Farewell Letter,Love is more; I want more
Passion,Farewell Letter,I thought I knew what love was
Passion,Farewell Letter,I do know that it's not a negotiation
Passion,Farewell Letter,What we had
Passion,Farewell Letter,Wasn't bad
Passion,Farewell Letter,How sad
Passion,Farewell Letter,Then what we have is nothing
Passion,Farewell Letter,Nothing
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,The letter from Clara...
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Yes?
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,It's over. Finished.
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,I'm sorry.
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Sorry? I would have thought that you would be pleased.
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,I don't wish to see you sad.
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,"I feel so much... but I'm not really sad,,,"
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,I thought you loved Clara?
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,"I did love Clara. I did, but..."
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,No one has ever loved me
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,As deeply as you
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,No one has truly loved me
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,"As you have, Fosca"
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Love without reason
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Love without mercy
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Love without pride or shame
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Love unconcerned
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,With being returned—
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,"No wisdom, no judgment"
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,"No caution, no blame"
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,No one has ever known me
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,As clearly as you
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,No one has ever shown me
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,What love could be like until now
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Not pretty or safe or easy
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,But more than I ever knew
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Love within reason—that isn't love
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,And I've learned that from you...
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Are you cold?
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,"No, I'm afraid."
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Of what?
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,All this happiness
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Coming when there's so little time
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Too much happiness
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,More than I can bear
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,"You do love me, don't you?"
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,"Yes, I love you."
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,Say it again.
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,I love you.
Passion,No One Has Ever Loved Me,"Be calm, strong. I am yours"
Passion,Finale (Passion),I'm filling up our room
Passion,Finale (Passion),Our little room
Passion,Finale (Passion),With every flower in bloom
Passion,Finale (Passion),I'll have the fire lit
Passion,Finale (Passion),The table set
Passion,Finale (Passion),I'll wear the blue chemise
Passion,Finale (Passion),Imagining your fingers touching mine
Passion,Finale (Passion),Imagining our room
Passion,Finale (Passion),"The bed, the secrecy"
Passion,Finale (Passion),The world outside
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your mouth on mine
Passion,Finale (Passion),"The town, it"
Passion,Finale (Passion),"Is remote, isn't it?"
Passion,Finale (Passion),And provincial
Passion,Finale (Passion),Don't you think?
Passion,Finale (Passion),The time has come to face the truth
Passion,Finale (Passion),Signorina
Passion,Finale (Passion),This sterile little town
Passion,Finale (Passion),These pompous little men
Passion,Finale (Passion),This military madness
Passion,Finale (Passion),"Uniforms, uniforms"
Passion,Finale (Passion),An unattractive woman
Passion,Finale (Passion),Is easily deceived
Passion,Finale (Passion),My dearest Giorgio
Passion,Finale (Passion),"The end is near. The time has come for me to surrender life gracefully. These past two days since you have left, since we were together, have been a revelation"
Passion,Finale (Passion),Now at last I see what comes from feeling loved
Passion,Finale (Passion),"Strange, how merely feeling loved"
Passion,Finale (Passion),You see things clearly
Passion,Finale (Passion),Things I feared
Passion,Finale (Passion),Like the world itself
Passion,Finale (Passion),I now love dearly
Passion,Finale (Passion),I want to live
Passion,Finale (Passion),Now I want to live
Passion,Finale (Passion),Just from being loved
Passion,Finale (Passion),All that pain I nursed inside
Passion,Finale (Passion),For all those years
Passion,Finale (Passion),All that vain and bitter self-concern
Passion,Finale (Passion),All those tears and all that pride
Passion,Finale (Passion),Have vanished into air
Passion,Finale (Passion),I don't want to leave
Passion,Finale (Passion),Now that I am loved
Passion,Finale (Passion),I don't want to leave
Passion,Finale (Passion),Everywhere I turn
Passion,Finale (Passion),You are there
Passion,Finale (Passion),Everywhere I look
Passion,Finale (Passion),Things are different
Passion,Finale (Passion),Everything seems right
Passion,Finale (Passion),Everything seems possible
Passion,Finale (Passion),Every moment bursts with feeling
Passion,Finale (Passion),Why is love so easy to give
Passion,Finale (Passion),And so hard to receive?
Passion,Finale (Passion),But though I want to live
Passion,Finale (Passion),I now can leave
Passion,Finale (Passion),With what I never knew:
Passion,Finale (Passion),I'm someone to be loved
Passion,Finale (Passion),I'm someone to be loved
Passion,Finale (Passion),And that I learned from you
Passion,Finale (Passion),I don't know how I let you
Passion,Finale (Passion),So far inside my mind
Passion,Finale (Passion),But there you are and there you will stay
Passion,Finale (Passion),How could I ever wish you away?
Passion,Finale (Passion),I see now I was blind
Passion,Finale (Passion),And should you die tomorrow
Passion,Finale (Passion),Another thing I see:
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
Passion,Finale (Passion),Your love will live in me...
