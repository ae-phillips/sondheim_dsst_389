Company,Another Hundred People,Another hundred people just got off of the bus
Company,Another Hundred People,And are looking around at
Company,Another Hundred People,Another hundred who got off of the plane
Company,Another Hundred People,And are looking at us
Company,Another Hundred People,Who got off of the train
Company,Another Hundred People,And the plane and the bus
Company,Another Hundred People,Maybe yesterday
Company,Another Hundred People,It’s a city of strangers
Company,Another Hundred People,"Some come to work, some to play"
Company,Another Hundred People,A city of strangers
Company,Another Hundred People,"Some come to stare, some to stay"
Company,Another Hundred People,"And every day, the ones who stay..."
Company,Another Hundred People,Can find each other in the crowded streets
Company,Another Hundred People,And the guarded parks
Company,Another Hundred People,By the rusty fountains and the dusty trees
Company,Another Hundred People,With the battered barks
Company,Another Hundred People,And they walk together past the postered walls
Company,Another Hundred People,With the crude remarks
Company,Another Hundred People,And they meet at parties with the friends of friends
Company,Another Hundred People,Who they never know
Company,Another Hundred People,“Will you pick it up or should I meet you there?”
Company,Another Hundred People,“Shall we let it go?”
Company,Another Hundred People,“Did you get my message
Company,Another Hundred People,Cause I looked in vain?”
Company,Another Hundred People,“Can we see each other Tuesday
Company,Another Hundred People,If it doesn’t rain?”
Company,Another Hundred People,"“Look, I’ll call you in the morning"
Company,Another Hundred People,Or my service will explain”
Company,Another Hundred People,And another hundred people just got off of the train
Company,Another Hundred People,I didn’t come right to New York
Company,Another Hundred People,I went to Northwestern University for two years
Company,Another Hundred People,But it was a pitiful mistake
Company,Another Hundred People,I was on probation the whole two years
Company,Another Hundred People,I was getting ready to go back to Shaker Heights
Company,Another Hundred People,When I decided where I really wanted to live
Company,Another Hundred People,More than any other place
Company,Another Hundred People,Was Radio City
Company,Another Hundred People,I thought it was a wonderful little city
Company,Another Hundred People,Near New York
Company,Another Hundred People,So I came here
Company,Another Hundred People,I’m very dumb
Company,Another Hundred People,I find you very interesting
Company,Another Hundred People,Well... I’m just not
Company,Another Hundred People,I used to think I was so odd
Company,Another Hundred People,But my roommate is the same way
Company,Another Hundred People,He’s also very dumb
Company,Another Hundred People,Oh?
Company,Another Hundred People,You never mentioned him
Company,Another Hundred People,Is he... your lover?
Company,Another Hundred People,No
Company,Another Hundred People,We just share this great big apartment
Company,Another Hundred People,On West End Avenue
Company,Another Hundred People,"I’d show it to you, but we’ve never had company"
Company,Another Hundred People,He’s the sweetest thing actually
Company,Another Hundred People,I think he likes the arrangement
Company,Another Hundred People,"I don’t know, though, we never discuss it"
Company,Another Hundred People,"He was born in New York, so..."
Company,Another Hundred People,Nothing really interests him
Company,Another Hundred People,I don’t have anything more to say
Company,Another Hundred People,And they find each other in the crowded streets
Company,Another Hundred People,And the guarded parks
Company,Another Hundred People,By the rusty fountains and the dusty trees
Company,Another Hundred People,With the battered barks
Company,Another Hundred People,And they walk together past the postered walls
Company,Another Hundred People,With the crude remarks

Company,Another Hundred People,"“Look, I’ll call you in the morning"
Company,Another Hundred People,Or my service will explain”
Company,Another Hundred People,And another hundred people just got off of the train
Company,Another Hundred People,"This is really exciting, Kathy, fascinating"
Company,Another Hundred People,"Robert, you’re awful"
Company,Another Hundred People,"You come here a lot, huh?"
Company,Another Hundred People,Terrific
Company,Another Hundred People,"Hey, maybe next we could go watch a haircut"
Company,Another Hundred People,You cannot bare that with a big party going on
Company,Another Hundred People,I talked you into coming here with me
Company,Another Hundred People,A party? What p—
Company,Another Hundred People,"Oh, that party"
Company,Another Hundred People,"Oh, yeah, I’d completely forgotten about that party"
Company,Another Hundred People,"But hey, maybe we can still make it"
Company,Another Hundred People,"Robert, try to enjoy this"
Company,Another Hundred People,Imagine being in a tiny quiet little pocket of a park
Company,Another Hundred People,"Right here, in the middle of the busy, noisy East 50’s"
Company,Another Hundred People,A part that’s simple and pretty
Company,Another Hundred People,That waterfall on the wall over there?
Company,Another Hundred People,It always makes me ache to be back at the cape
Company,Another Hundred People,"You are some piece of work, lady"
Company,Another Hundred People,What I am is like this park here
Company,Another Hundred People,Out of place
Company,Another Hundred People,You are like this park
Company,Another Hundred People,Very lovely
Company,Another Hundred People,Very
Company,Another Hundred People,I’ve never let you know
Company,Another Hundred People,"What a good, good man I think you are"
Company,Another Hundred People,And how much you’ve met Robert
Company,Another Hundred People,I brought you here because...
Company,Another Hundred People,I wanted to tell you alone
Company,Another Hundred People,I’m moving back up to cape cod
Company,Another Hundred People,I’m getting married
Company,Another Hundred People,Married?
Company,Another Hundred People,"Well, yeah, some people still get married, y’know"
Company,Another Hundred People,Did you just suddenly fall in love?
Company,Another Hundred People,I’ll be a good wife
Company,Another Hundred People,I want real things
Company,Another Hundred People,"A husband, family..."
Company,Another Hundred People,I think there’s a time to come to New York
Company,Another Hundred People,And a time to leave
Company,Another Hundred People,Enjoy your party
Company,Another Hundred People,Another hundred people just got off of the train
Company,Another Hundred People,And came up through the ground while
Company,Another Hundred People,Another hundred people just got off of the bus
Company,Another Hundred People,And are looking around at
Company,Another Hundred People,Another hundred who got off of the plane

Company,Another Hundred People,A city of strangers
Company,Another Hundred People,"Some come to stare, some to stay"
Company,Another Hundred People,"And every day, some go away..."
Company,Another Hundred People,Or they find each other in the crowded streets
Company,Another Hundred People,And the guarded parks
Company,Another Hundred People,By the rusty fountains and the dusty trees
Company,Another Hundred People,With the battered barks
Company,Another Hundred People,And they walk together past the postered walls

Company,Another Hundred People,And another hundred people just got off of the train
Company,Another Hundred People,And another hundred people just got off of the train
Company,Another Hundred People,Another hundred people just got off of the train
Company,Getting Married Today,Bless this day
Company,Getting Married Today,Pinnacle of life
Company,Getting Married Today,Husband joined to wife
Company,Getting Married Today,The heart leaps up to behold
Company,Getting Married Today,This golden day
Company,Getting Married Today,"Amy, I can’t find my shoes!"
Company,Getting Married Today,Today is for Amy
Company,Getting Married Today,"Amy, I give you the rest of my life"
Company,Getting Married Today,To cherish and to keep you
Company,Getting Married Today,To honor you forever
Company,Getting Married Today,Today is for Amy
Company,Getting Married Today,My happily soon-to-be wife
Company,Getting Married Today,"Amy, we’re really gettin’ married"
Company,Getting Married Today,"Pardon me, is everybody there?"
Company,Getting Married Today,Because if everybody’s there
Company,Getting Married Today,I’d like to thank you all
Company,Getting Married Today,For coming to the wedding
Company,Getting Married Today,I’d appreciate you going even more
Company,Getting Married Today,I mean you must have lots of better things to do
Company,Getting Married Today,And not a word of it to Paul
Company,Getting Married Today,Remember Paul?
Company,Getting Married Today,"You know, the man I’m gonna marry"
Company,Getting Married Today,But I’m not
Company,Getting Married Today,Because I wouldn’t ruin anyone as wonderful as he is
Company,Getting Married Today,But I thank you all
Company,Getting Married Today,For the gifts and the flowers
Company,Getting Married Today,Thank you all
Company,Getting Married Today,Now it’s back to the showers
Company,Getting Married Today,Don’t tell Paul
Company,Getting Married Today,But I’m not getting married today
Company,Getting Married Today,Bless this day
Company,Getting Married Today,Tragedy of life
Company,Getting Married Today,Husband yoked to wife
Company,Getting Married Today,The heart sinks down and feels dead
Company,Getting Married Today,This dreadful day
Company,Getting Married Today,"Amy, Paul can’t find his good cufflinks"
Company,Getting Married Today,They’re on the dresser...
Company,Getting Married Today,Right next to my suicide note
Company,Getting Married Today,"Listen everybody, look"
Company,Getting Married Today,I don’t know what you’re waiting for
Company,Getting Married Today,A wedding? What’s a wedding?
Company,Getting Married Today,It’s a prehistoric ritual
Company,Getting Married Today,Where everybody promises fidelity forever
Company,Getting Married Today,Which is maybe the most horrifying word I've ever heard
Company,Getting Married Today,And which is followed by a honeymoon
Company,Getting Married Today,"Where suddenly, he’ll realize"
Company,Getting Married Today,He‘s saddled with a nut
Company,Getting Married Today,"And wanna kill me, which he should"
Company,Getting Married Today,"So listen, thanks a bunch"
Company,Getting Married Today,But I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,Go have lunch
Company,Getting Married Today,Cause I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,You’ve been grand
Company,Getting Married Today,But I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,Don’t just stand there
Company,Getting Married Today,I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,And don’t tell Paul
Company,Getting Married Today,But I’m not getting married today
Company,Getting Married Today,Go! Can’t you go?
Company,Getting Married Today,Why is nobody listening
Company,Getting Married Today,Goodbye
Company,Getting Married Today,Go and cry at another person’s wake
Company,Getting Married Today,If you’re quick for a kick
Company,Getting Married Today,You could pick up a christening
Company,Getting Married Today,"But please, on my knees"
Company,Getting Married Today,There’s a human life at stake
Company,Getting Married Today,Listen everybody
Company,Getting Married Today,I’m afraid you didn’t hear
Company,Getting Married Today,Or do you wanna see a crazy lady
Company,Getting Married Today,Fall apart in front of you?
Company,Getting Married Today,It isn’t only Paul who will be ruining his life
Company,Getting Married Today,"You know, we’ll both of us be losing our identities"
Company,Getting Married Today,I telephoned my analyst about it
Company,Getting Married Today,And he said to see him Monday
Company,Getting Married Today,But by Monday
Company,Getting Married Today,I’ll be floating in the Hudson with the other garbage
Company,Getting Married Today,I’m not well
Company,Getting Married Today,So I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,You’ve been swell
Company,Getting Married Today,But I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,Clear the hall
Company,Getting Married Today,Cause I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,Thank you all
Company,Getting Married Today,But I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,And don’t tell Paul
Company,Getting Married Today,But I’m not getting married today
Company,Getting Married Today,Bless this bride
Company,Getting Married Today,Totally insane
Company,Getting Married Today,Slipping down the drain
Company,Getting Married Today,And bless this day in our hearts
Company,Getting Married Today,As is starts to rain
Company,Getting Married Today,Today is for Amy
Company,Getting Married Today,(Go! Can’t you go?)
Company,Getting Married Today,"Amy, I give you"
Company,Getting Married Today,"(Look, you know I adore you all)"
Company,Getting Married Today,The rest of my life
Company,Getting Married Today,(But why watch me die like Eliza on the ice?)
Company,Getting Married Today,To cherish and to keep you
Company,Getting Married Today,"(Look, perhaps I’ll collapse in the apse right before you)"
Company,Getting Married Today,To honor you forever
Company,Getting Married Today,"(Also take back the cake, burn the shoes and boil the rice)"
Company,Getting Married Today,Today is for Amy
Company,Getting Married Today,"(Look, I didn’t want to have to tell you)"
Company,Getting Married Today,(But I may be coming down with hepatitis)
Company,Getting Married Today,My happily soon-to-be wife
Company,Getting Married Today,"(And I think I’m gonna faint,)"
Company,Getting Married Today,"(So if you’re want to see me faint,)"
Company,Getting Married Today,"(I’d do it happily, but wouldn’t it be funnier)"
Company,Getting Married Today,My adorable wife
Company,Getting Married Today,(To go and watch a funeral?)
Company,Getting Married Today,(So thank you for the twenty-seven dinner plates)
Company,Getting Married Today,(And thirty-seven butter knives)
Company,Getting Married Today,(And forty-seven paper weights)
Company,Getting Married Today,(And fifty-seven candle holders)
Company,Getting Married Today,One more thing
Company,Getting Married Today,I am not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,Softly said (Amen)
Company,Getting Married Today,But I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,With this ring (Amen)
Company,Getting Married Today,Still I’m not getting married
Company,Getting Married Today,I thee wed (Amen)
Company,Getting Married Today,"See, I’m not getting married"
Company,Getting Married Today,Let us pray (Let us pray)
Company,Getting Married Today,That we’re not getting married (That we are getting married)
Company,Getting Married Today,Today (Amen)

Company,Side by Side by Side,Being the kids
