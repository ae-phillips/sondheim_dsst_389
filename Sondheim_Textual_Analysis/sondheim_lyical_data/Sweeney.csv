Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,"Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion"
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,"Well, it does seem a waste..."

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,Is it really good?
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,"Sir, it's too good, at least!"
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,"Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh,"
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,So it's pretty fresh.
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,Awful lot of fat.
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,Only where it sat.
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,"Haven't you got poet, or something like that?"

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,"Not as hearty as bishop, perhaps,"
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,"but then again, not as bland as curate, either!"
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,A Little Priest,"And good for business, too -- always leaves you wantin' more!"
