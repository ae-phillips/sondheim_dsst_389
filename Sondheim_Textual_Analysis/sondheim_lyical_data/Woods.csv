Into the Woods,I Guess This Is Goodbye,It won't be on a plate
Into the Woods,I Guess This Is Goodbye,Take the cow and go home!
Into the Woods,I Guess This Is Goodbye,I was trying to be helpful
Into the Woods,I Guess This Is Goodbye,Magic beans! We've no reason to believe they're magic. Are we going to dispel this curse through deceit?
Into the Woods,I Guess This Is Goodbye,No one would have given him more for that creature.We did him a favor. Least now they'll have some food
Into the Woods,I Guess This Is Goodbye,Five beans!
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,If you know

Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,Or you live to regret it
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,Will you please go home?
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,There are rights and wrongs
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,And in-betweens-

Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,What you do
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,That's the point
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,All the rest of it
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,Is chatter
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,"Look at her, she's crying"
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,If the thing you do
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,Is pure in intent
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,If it's meant
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,And it's just a little bent
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,Does it matter?
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,Yes
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,"No, what matters is that"
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,Everyone tells tiny lies-
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,"What's important, really, is the size"
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,What?
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,Only three more tries
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,And we'll have our prize
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,When the end's in sight
Into the Woods,Maybe They're Magic,You'll realize:

Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,And he showed me things
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,Many beautiful things
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,That I hadn't thought to explore
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,They were off my path
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,So I never had dared

Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,"Though, I really got scared-"
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,"Well, excited and scared"
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,But he drew me close
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,And he swallowed me down

Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,Seemed to disappear forever
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,At the end of the path
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,Was Granny once again
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,So we wait in the dark
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,Until someone sets us free

Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,The way that they should
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,And take extra care with strangers-
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,Even flowers have their dangers
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,And though scary is exciting
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,Nice is different than good
Into the Woods,I Know Things Now,Now I know:

Into the Woods,Giants In The Sky,At the world you've left
Into the Woods,Giants In The Sky,And the things you know
Into the Woods,Giants In The Sky,Little more than a glance

Into the Woods,It Takes Two,You've begun
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,It takes two of you
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,It's no fun
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,But what needs to be done
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,You can do
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,When there's two of you
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,If I dare
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,It's because I'm becoming
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,Aware of us
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,As a pair of us
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,Each accepting a share
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,Of what's there
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,We've changed
Into the Woods,It Takes Two,We're strangers

Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,He's a very smart Prince
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,He's a Prince who prepares
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,Knowing this time I'd run from him
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,He spread pitch on the stairs
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,I was caught unawares
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,"And I thought, well, he cares-"
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,This is more than just malice
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,Better stop and take stock

Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,"You think, well it's a thought"
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,What would be his response?
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,But then what if he knew
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,Who you were when you know
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,That you're not what he thinks
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,That he wants?
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,And then what if you are
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,What a Prince would envision?

Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,Who you are till you know
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,"What you want, which you don't?"
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,So then which do you pick:

Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,To arrive at a Ball is exciting and all-
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,"Once you're there, though, it's scary"
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,And it's fun to deceive

Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,Now it's he and not you
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,Who is stuck with the shoe
Into the Woods,On The Steps Of The Palace,In a stew

Into the Woods,Ever After,Ever after!
Into the Woods,Ever After,Ever after!
Into the Woods,Ever After,All the curses have been ended
Into the Woods,Ever After,The reverses wiped away
Into the Woods,Ever After,All is tenderness and laughter
Into the Woods,Ever After,For forever after!
Into the Woods,Ever After,Happy now and happy hence
Into the Woods,Ever After,And happy ever after!
Into the Woods,Ever After,There were dangers-
Into the Woods,Ever After,We were frightened-
Into the Woods,Ever After,And confusions-
Into the Woods,Ever After,But we hid it-
Into the Woods,Ever After,And the paths would often swerve
Into the Woods,Ever After,We did not
Into the Woods,Ever After,There were constant-
Into the Woods,Ever After,It's amazing-
Into the Woods,Ever After,Disillusions-
Into the Woods,Ever After,That we did it
Into the Woods,Ever After,But they never lost their nerve
Into the Woods,Ever After,Not a lot
Into the Woods,Ever After,And they (we) reached the right conclusions
Into the Woods,Ever After,And we (they) got what we (they) deserve!
Into the Woods,Ever After,Not a sigh and not a sorrow
Into the Woods,Ever After,Tenderness and laughter
Into the Woods,Ever After,Joy today and bliss tomorrow
Into the Woods,Ever After,And forever after!
Into the Woods,Ever After,I was greedy
Into the Woods,Ever After,I was vain
Into the Woods,Ever After,I was haughty
Into the Woods,Ever After,I was smug
Into the Woods,Ever After,We were happy
Into the Woods,Ever After,It was fun
Into the Woods,Ever After,But we were blind
Into the Woods,Ever After,Then we went into the woods
Into the Woods,Ever After,To get our wish
Into the Woods,Ever After,And now we're really blind
Into the Woods,Ever After,I was perfect
Into the Woods,Ever After,I had everything but beauty
Into the Woods,Ever After,I had power
Into the Woods,Ever After,And a daughter like a flower
Into the Woods,Ever After,In a tower
Into the Woods,Ever After,Then I went into the woods
Into the Woods,Ever After,To get my wish
Into the Woods,Ever After,And now I'm ordinary
Into the Woods,Ever After,"Lost my power, and my flower"
Into the Woods,Ever After,We're unworthy
Into the Woods,Ever After,"We're (I'm) unhappy now, unhappy hence"
Into the Woods,Ever After,As well as ever after
Into the Woods,Ever After,Had we used our common sense
Into the Woods,Ever After,Been worthy of our discontents...
Into the Woods,Ever After,"To be happy, and forever"
Into the Woods,Ever After,You must see your wish come true
Into the Woods,Ever After,"Don't be careful, don't be clever"
Into the Woods,Ever After,"When you see your wish, pursue"
Into the Woods,Ever After,It's a dangerous endeavor
Into the Woods,Ever After,But the only thing to do-
Into the Woods,Ever After,Though it's fearful
Into the Woods,Ever After,"Though it's deep, though it's dark"
Into the Woods,Ever After,And though you may lose the path
Into the Woods,Ever After,Though you may encounter wolves
Into the Woods,Ever After,You mustn't stop
Into the Woods,Ever After,You mustn't swerve
Into the Woods,Ever After,You mustn't ponder
Into the Woods,Ever After,You have to act!
Into the Woods,Ever After,When you know your wish
Into the Woods,Ever After,If you want your wish
Into the Woods,Ever After,You can have your wish
Into the Woods,Ever After,But you can't just wish-
Into the Woods,Ever After,"No, to get your wish"
Into the Woods,Ever After,You go into the woods
Into the Woods,Ever After,Where nothing's clear
Into the Woods,Ever After,"Where witches, ghosts"
Into the Woods,Ever After,And wolves appear
Into the Woods,Ever After,Into the woods
Into the Woods,Ever After,And through the fear
Into the Woods,Ever After,You have to take the journey
Into the Woods,Ever After,Into the woods
Into the Woods,Ever After,And down the dell
Into the Woods,Ever After,In vain perhaps
Into the Woods,Ever After,But who can tell?
Into the Woods,Ever After,Into the woods to lift the spell
Into the Woods,Ever After,Into the woods to lose the longing
Into the Woods,Ever After,Into the woods to have the child
Into the Woods,Ever After,To wed the Prince
Into the Woods,Ever After,To get the money
Into the Woods,Ever After,To save the house
Into the Woods,Ever After,To kill the wolf
Into the Woods,Ever After,To find the father
Into the Woods,Ever After,To conquer the kingdom
Into the Woods,Ever After,"To have, to wed"
Into the Woods,Ever After,"To get, to save"
Into the Woods,Ever After,"To kill, to keep"
Into the Woods,Ever After,To go to the Festival!
Into the Woods,Ever After,Into the woods
Into the Woods,Ever After,Into the woods
Into the Woods,Ever After,Into the woods
Into the Woods,Ever After,Then out of the woods-
Into the Woods,Ever After,To be continued!
Into the Woods,Ever After,And happy ever after!

Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),A thicket of briar
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),A hundred feet deep
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Agony!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),No frustration more keen
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),When the one thing you want
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Is a thing that you've not even seen
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),I found a casket
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Entirely of glass-

Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),"A maiden, alas"

Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Such that princes must weep!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Always in thrall most
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),To anything almost
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Or something asleep
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),If it were not for the thicket-
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),A thicket's no trick
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Is it thick?
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),It's the thickest
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),The quickest

Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Apart with a stick-
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),"Yes, but even one prick-"
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),It's my thing about blood
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),"Well, it's sick!"
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),It's no sicker
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Than your thing with dwarves!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Dwarfs?!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Dwarfs!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Dwarfs are very upsetting
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Not forgetting
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),The tasks unachievable
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Mountains unscalable-
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),If it's conceivable
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),But unavailable

Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Agony!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Misery!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Woe!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Not to know what you miss
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),While they lie there for years-
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),And you cry on their biers-
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),What unbearable bliss!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),Agony
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),That can cut like a knife!
Into the Woods,Agony (Reprise),"Ah well, back to my wife..."

Into the Woods,Witch's Lament,To learn
Into the Woods,Witch's Lament,Guide them along the way
Into the Woods,Witch's Lament,Still they won't listen

Into the Woods,Any Moment,"Well, yes, I do"
Into the Woods,Any Moment,And I... have a baker
Into the Woods,Any Moment,"Of course, you're right. How foolish"
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Foolishness can happen in the woods
Into the Woods,Any Moment,"Once again, please-"
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Let your hesitations be hushed
Into the Woods,Any Moment,"Any moment, big or small"
Into the Woods,Any Moment,"Is a moment, after all"
Into the Woods,Any Moment,"Seize the moment, skies may fall"
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Any moment
Into the Woods,Any Moment,But this is not right!
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Right and wrong don't matter in the woods
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Only feelings
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Let us meet the moment unblushed
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Life is often so unpleasant-
Into the Woods,Any Moment,"You must know that, as a peasant-"
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Best to take a moment present
Into the Woods,Any Moment,"As a present, for the moment"
Into the Woods,Any Moment,I must leave you
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Why?
Into the Woods,Any Moment,The giant
Into the Woods,Any Moment,The Giant. I had almost forgotten
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Will we find each other in the Woods again?
Into the Woods,Any Moment,This was just a moment in the woods
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Our moment
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Shimmering and lovely and sad
Into the Woods,Any Moment,"Leave the moment, just be glad"
Into the Woods,Any Moment,For the moment that we had
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Every moment is of moment
Into the Woods,Any Moment,When you're in the woods...
Into the Woods,Any Moment,Now I must go off to slay a Giant. But that is what the next moment holds for me
Into the Woods,Any Moment,I shall not forget you. How brave you are to be alone in the Woods. And how alive you've made me feel
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,What was that?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Was that me?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Was that him?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Did a prince really kiss me?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,And kiss me?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,And kiss me?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,And did I kiss him back?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Was it wrong?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Am I mad?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Is that all?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Does he miss me?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Was he suddenly
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Getting bored with me?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Wake up! Stop dreaming
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Stop prancing about the woods
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,It's not beseeming
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,What is it about the woods?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Back to life, back to sense"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Back to child, back to husband"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,No one lives in the woods
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"There are vows, there are ties"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"There are needs, there are standards"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,There are shouldn'ts and shoulds
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Why not both instead?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"There's the answer, if you're clever"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Have a child for warmth
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,And a baker for bread
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,And a prince for whatever-
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Never!
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,It's these woods
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Face the facts, find the boy"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Join the group, stop the giant"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Just get out of the woods
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Was that him? Yes, it was"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Was that me? No, it wasn't"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Just a trick of the woods
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Just a moment
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,One peculiar passing moment...
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Must it all be either less or more
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Either plain or grand?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Is it always ""or""?"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Is it never ""and""?"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,That's what woods are for
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,For those moments in the woods
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Oh, if life were made of moments"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Even now and then a bad one-!
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,But if life were only moments
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Then you'd never know you had one
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"First a witch, then a child"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Then a prince, then a moment-"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Who could live in the woods?
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,And to get what you wish
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Only just for a moment-
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,These are dangerous woods...
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Let the moment go
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Don't forget it for a moment, though"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Just remembering you've had an ""and"""
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"When you're back to ""or"""
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,"Makes the ""or"" mean more"
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Than it did before
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,Now I understand-
Into the Woods,Moments In The Woods,And it's time to leave the woods!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"It's because of you there's a Giant in our midst, and my wife is dead!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,But it isn't my fault
Into the Woods,Your Fault,I was given those beans!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,You persuaded me to trade away
Into the Woods,Your Fault,My cow for beans!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,And without those beans
Into the Woods,Your Fault,There'd have been no stalk
Into the Woods,Your Fault,To get up to the giants
Into the Woods,Your Fault,In the first place!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Wait a minute, magic beans"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,For a cow so old
Into the Woods,Your Fault,That you had to tell
Into the Woods,Your Fault,A lie to sell
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"It, which you told!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Were they worthless beans?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Were they oversold?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Oh, and tell us who"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Persuaded you
Into the Woods,Your Fault,To steal that gold!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"See, it's your fault"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,No!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,So it's your fault
Into the Woods,Your Fault,No!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Yes, it is!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,It's not!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,It's true
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Wait a minute, though-"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,I only stole the gold
Into the Woods,Your Fault,To get my cow back
Into the Woods,Your Fault,From you!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,So it's your fault!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Yes!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"No, it isn't!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,I'd have kept those beans
Into the Woods,Your Fault,But our house was cursed
Into the Woods,Your Fault,She made us get a cow
Into the Woods,Your Fault,To get the curse reversed!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,It's his father's fault
Into the Woods,Your Fault,That the curse got placed
Into the Woods,Your Fault,And the place got cursed
Into the Woods,Your Fault,In the first place!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Oh
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Then it's his fault!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,So...
Into the Woods,Your Fault,It was his fault...
Into the Woods,Your Fault,No
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Yes, it is"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,It's his
Into the Woods,Your Fault,I guess...
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Wait a minute, though-"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,I chopped down the beanstalk
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Right? That's clear
Into the Woods,Your Fault,But without any beanstalk
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Then what's queer
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Is how did the second giant get down here
Into the Woods,Your Fault,In the first place?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Second place...?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Yes!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,How?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Hmm...
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Well
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Who had the other bean?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,The other bean?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,The other bean?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,You pocketed the other bean
Into the Woods,Your Fault,I didn't!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Yes, I did"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,So it's your f-!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"No, it isn't"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Cause I gave it to my wife!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,So it's her f-!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"No, it isn't!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Then whose is it?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Wait a minute!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,She exchanged that bean
Into the Woods,Your Fault,To obtain your shoe
Into the Woods,Your Fault,So the one who knows what happened
Into the Woods,Your Fault,To the bean is you!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,You mean that old bean-
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"That your wife-? Oh, dear-"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,But I never knew
Into the Woods,Your Fault,And so I threw-
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Well, don't look here!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,So it's your fault!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,But-
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"See, it's her fault-!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,But-
Into the Woods,Your Fault,And it isn't mine at all!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,But what?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Well, if you hadn't gone"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Back up again-
Into the Woods,Your Fault,We were needy-
Into the Woods,Your Fault,You were greedy!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Did you need that hen?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,But I got it for my mother!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,So it's her fault then!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Yes, and what about the harp"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,In the third place?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,The harp-yes!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,She went and dared me to!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,I dared you to?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,You dared me to!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,She said that I was scared
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Me?
Into the Woods,Your Fault,-to
Into the Woods,Your Fault,She dared me!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"No, I didn't!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,So it's your fault!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Wait a minute-!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,If you hadn't dared him to-
Into the Woods,Your Fault,And you had left the harp alone
Into the Woods,Your Fault,We wouldn't be in trouble
Into the Woods,Your Fault,In the first place!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Well, if you hadn't thrown away the bean"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,In the first place-!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,It was your fault!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Well, if she hadn't raised them in the first place-!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,"Yes, if you hadn't raised them in the first place-!"
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Right! It's you who raised them in the first place-!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,You raised the beans in the first place!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,It's your fault!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,You're responsible!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,You're the one to blame!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,It's your fault!
Into the Woods,Your Fault,Shhhh!
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,It's the last midnight
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,It's the last wish
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,It's the last midnight
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Soon it will be boom-

Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Nothing we can do-
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Not exactly true
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,We can always give her the boy
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,No?
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,"No, of course, what really matters is the blame"
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Somebody to blame
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,"Fine, if that's the thing you enjoy"
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Placing the blame
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,If that's the aim
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Give me the blame-
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Just give me the boy
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,No!
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,No...
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,You're so nice
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,You're not good
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,You're not bad
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,You're just nice
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,I'm not good
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,I'm not nice
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,I'm just right
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,I'm the witch
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,You're the world
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,I'm the hitch
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,I'm what no one believes
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,I'm the witch
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,You're all liars and thieves
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Like his father!
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,"Like his son will be, too-"
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,"Oh, why bother?"
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,You'll just do what you do
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,It's the last midnight
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,"So goodbye, all"
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,"Coming at you fast, midnight-"
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Soon you'll see the sky fall!
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,"Here, you want a bean?"
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Have another bean
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Beans were made for making you rich!
Into the Woods,Last Midnight,Plant them and they soar-
