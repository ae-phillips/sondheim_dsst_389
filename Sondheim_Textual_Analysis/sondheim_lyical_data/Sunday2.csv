Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,That someone tore off in a hurry...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,What's the muddle
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,In the middle?
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,That's the puddle
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Where the poodle
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Did the piddle
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Taking the day on Sunday
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Now that the dreary week is dead
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Getting away on Sunday
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Brightens the dreary week ahead
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Everyone's on display on Sunday
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,The day off!
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Bonnet flapping
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Bustle sliding
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Like a rocking horse that nobody's been riding
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,There's a daisy...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,And some clover...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,And that interesting fellow looking over...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Nurse!
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,One day is much like any other
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Listening to her snap and drone
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Still, Sunday with someone's dotty mother"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Is better then Sunday with your own
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Mothers may drone, mothers may whine—"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Tending to his, though, is perfectly fine"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,It pays for the nurse that is tending to mine
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,On Sunday—
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,My day off
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"You know, Franz, I believe that artist is drawing us."
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Who?
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Monsieur's friend.
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Monsieur would never think to draw us! We are only people he looks down upon.
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Second bottle...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Ah, she looks for me..."
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,He is bursting to go...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Near the fountain...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,I could let him...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,How to manage it?
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,No
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,I should have been an artist. I was never intended for work.
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Artists work, Franz. I believe they work very hard."
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Work!... We work.
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,We serve their food
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,We carve their meat
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,We tend to their house
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,We polish their
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Silverware
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,The food we serve
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,We also eat
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,For them we rush
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Wash and brush
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Wipe and wax—
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Franz, relax"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"While he ""creates"""
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,We scrape their plates
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,And dust their knickknacks
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Hundreds to the shelf
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Work is what you do for others
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Liebchen
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Art is what you do for yourself
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Look!
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Where?
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Soldiers.
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Alone.
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,What do you think? I like the one in the light hat.
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Mademoiselles
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,I and my friend
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,We are but soldiers!
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Passing the time
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,In between wars
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,For weeks at an end
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Both of them are perfect
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,You can have the other
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,I don't want the other
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,I don't want the other either
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,And after a week
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Spent mostly indoors
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,With nothing but soldiers
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Ladies, I and my friend"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Trust we will not offend
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Which we'd never intend
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,By suggesting we spend—
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Oh, spend—!"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,This magnificent Sunday—
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Oh, Sunday—"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,With you and your friend
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,The one on the right's an awful bore
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,He's been in a war
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,We may get a meal and we might get more...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,It's certainly fine for Sunday...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,It's certainly fine for Sunday...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,It's certainly fine for Sunday...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"You and me, pal"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,We're the loonies
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Did you know that?
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Bet you didn't know that
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Cause we tell them the truth!
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Who you drawing?
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Who the hell you think you're drawing?
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Me?
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,You don't know me!
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Go on drawing
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Since you're drawing only what you want to see
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Anyway!
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"One eye, no illusion—"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,That you get with two
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,One for what is true
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,One for what suits you
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Draw your wrong conclusion
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,All you artists do
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,I see what is true...
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Taking the day on Sunday
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,After another week is dead
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Nurse!
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Getting away on Sunday
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Brightens the dreary week ahead
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Nurse!
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Leaving the city pressure
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Behind you
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Off where the air is fresher
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,"Where green, blue"
Sunday in the Park with George,The Day Off,Blind you—
Sunday in the Park with George,Everybody Loves Louis,"Hello, George..."
Sunday in the Park with George,Everybody Loves Louis,"Where did you go, George?"

Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,They have never understood
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,And no reason that they should
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,But if anybody could...
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Finishing the hat
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,How you have to finish the hat
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,How you watch the rest of the world
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,From a window
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,While you finish the hat
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Mapping out a sky
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,"What you feel like, planning a sky"
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,What you feel when voices that come
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Through the window
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Go
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Until they distance and die
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Until there's nothing but sky
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,And how you're always turning back too late
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,From the grass or the stick
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Or the dog or the light
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,How the kind of woman willing to wait's
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Not the kind that you want to find waiting
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,To return you to the night
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Dizzy from the height
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Coming from the hat
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Studying the hat
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Entering the world of the hat
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Reaching through the world of the hat
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Like a window
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Back to this one from that
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Studying a face
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Stepping back to look at a face
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Leaves a little space in the way like a window
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,But to see—
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,It's the only way to see
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,And when the woman that you wanted goes
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,"You can say to yourself, ""Well, I give what I give"""
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,But the woman who won't wait for you knows
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,That however you live
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,There's a part of you always standing by
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Mapping out the sky
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Finishing a hat
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Starting on a hat
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Finishing a hat...
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,"Look, I made a hat..."
Sunday in the Park with George,Finishing the Hat,Where there never was a hat
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"Yes, George, run to your work"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Hide behind your painting
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I've come to tell you I am leaving because I thought you might care to know
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"Foolish of me, because you care about nothing"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I care about many things—
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Things—not people
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"People, too"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I cannot divide my feelings up as neatly as you
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,And I am not hiding behind my canvas—I am living in it
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,What you care for is yourself
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I care for this painting
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,You will be in this painting
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I am something you can use
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I had thought you understood
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,It's because I understand that I left
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,That I am leaving
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Then there's nothing I can say
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Is there?
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"Yes. George, there is:"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,You could tell me not to go
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Say it to me
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Tell me not to go
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Tell me that you're hurt
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Tell me you're relieved
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Tell me that you're bored—
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"Anything, but don't assume I know"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Tell me what you feel!
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,What I feel?
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,You know exactly how I feel
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Why do you insist
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,You must hear the words
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,When you know I cannot give you words?
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Not the ones you need
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,There's nothing to say
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I cannot be what you want
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"What do you want, George?"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I needed you and you left
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,There was no room for me-
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,You will not accept who I am
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I am what I do—
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Which you knew
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Which you always knew
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Which I thought you were a part of!
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,No
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"You are complete, George"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,You are your own
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,We do not belong together
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"You are complete, George"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,You all alone
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I am unfinished
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I am diminished
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,With or without you
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,We do not belong together
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,And we should have belonged together
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,What made it so right together
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,Is what made it all wrong
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"No one is you, George"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,There we agree
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"But others will do, George"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,No one is you and
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,No one can be
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"But no one is me, George"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,No one is me!
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,We do not belong together
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,And we'll never belong—!
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,You have a mission
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,A mission to see
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,"Now I have one too, George"
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,And we should have belonged together
Sunday in the Park with George,We Do Not Belong Together,I have to move on
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Changing
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,It keeps changing
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,I see towers
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Where there were trees
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Going
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,All the stillness
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,The solitude
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Georgie
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Sundays
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Disappearing
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,All the time
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,When things were beautiful...
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,All things are beautiful
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Mother
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,"All trees, all towers"
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Beautiful
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,That tower—
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,"Beautiful, Mother"
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,See?
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,A perfect tree
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,"Pretty isn't beautiful, Mother"
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Pretty is what changes
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,What the eye arranges
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Is what is beautiful
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Fading...
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,I'm changing...
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,You're changing...
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,It keeps fading...
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,I'll draw us now before we fade
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Mother
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,It keeps melting before our eyes
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,You watch
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,While I revise the world
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Changing
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,As we sit here—
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,"Quick, draw it all, Georgie!"
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Sundays—
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Disappearing
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,As we look
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Look!...
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,Look!...
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,You make it beautiful
Sunday in the Park with George,Beautiful,"Oh, Georgie, how I long for the old view."
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,"Remember, George."
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Order.

Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Let us pass
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Through our perfect park
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Pausing on a Sunday
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,By the cool
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Blue triangular water
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,On the soft
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Green elliptical grass
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,As we pass
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Through arrangements of shadows
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Towards the verticals of trees
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Forever...
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,By the blue
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Purple yellow red water
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,On the green
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Orange violet mass
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Of the grass
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,In our perfect park
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Made of flecks of light
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,And dark
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,And parasols...
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Bumbum bum bumbumbum
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Bumbum bum...
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,People strolling through the trees
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Of a small suburban park
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,On an island in the river
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,On an ordinary Sunday...
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Sunday...
Sunday in the Park with George,Sunday,Sunday...
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,It's hot up here

Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,I hate this dress
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,The soldiers have forgotten us
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,The boatman schvitzes
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,I am completely out of proportion.
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,These helmets weigh a lot on us
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,This tree is blocking my view
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,I can't see anything
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,Why are they complaining?

Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,No matter what
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,There's not a breath
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,Of air up here
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,And they're up here
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,Forever
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,It's not my fault
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,I got up here
Sunday in the Park with George,It's Hot Up Here,I'll rot up here
